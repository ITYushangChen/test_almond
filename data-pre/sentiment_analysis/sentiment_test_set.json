I got pulled into the office on the day of the power outage and asked why I couldn’t put the overhead transformer on the ground, or paint it or put it on a different pole. They even took my joke about throwing camouflage netting over the transformer seriously. One of the men who applied had been at the company for years, had done the job temporarily for years, had an electrical trade and was very well loved by everyone in the section, yet didn’t get the job.\n\nNot to mention it’s pretty well known HR wants majority female apprentices. It’s bringing up so many issues. They get protected so much that we have female apprentices finishing up that can’t do very simple tasks but instead of being performance managed they’re able to just refuse to do it till a male does it. Not to mention almost all female apprentices we’ve had have gone into the office within two years post-apprenticeship due to injury leaving us very short staffed in the field. Our HR team also likes to hire female apprentices who can’t get their truck licence so everytime we work rural someone has to pack up equipment to drive them to the bathroom.",
