IgeHOZHkAOU,Inside Rio Tinto’s most advanced mine,"Sky News Business Editor Edward Boyd has travelled to Rio Tinto’s Gudai-Darri mine in Western Australia to see the mining corporation's newest and most technologically advanced mine.

This is the first large-scale media trip Rio Tinto has hosted since the Juukan Gorge scandal – which saw 46,000-year-old aboriginal shelters blown up by the company. 

The $3.1 billion Gudai-Darri mine began its production in 2021 and reached its capacity of 43 million tonnes in less than four months.

Rio Tinto plans to invest a further $130 million – expanding the mine's output to 50 million tonnes. 

Gudai-Darri uses autonomous trucks, drills, water carts and trains – as well as remote control robots that inspect conveyor belts for bearing failures and damage.

The driverless trucks only stop to be refuelled or serviced.",Sky News Australia,UCO0akufu9MOzyz3nvGIXAAw,2023-10-23T02:42:20Z,"['6339686389112', 'business', 'fb', 'msn', 'yt']",25,261852,1793,198,PT6M20S,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgeHOZHkAOU

6HOF8bC8vVg,Why Mining Giant Rio Tinto Is Benefitting From The EV Boom,"Copper mines, like this one in Utah, are on the frontline of America’s transition to clean energy. This site, owned and operated by mining giant Rio Tinto, produces roughly 200,000 metric tons of copper annually — with room to grow. Global demand for copper, a major component of EVs, is expected to almost double from 25 million metric tons to nearly 49 million metric tons by 2035. But miners face a multitude of issues as they ramp up production, not least of which includes mitigating environmental damage, addressing the concerns of the local stakeholders, and operating in remote regions of the world. 

Based in the UK, Rio Tinto is one of the world’s largest mining companies with projects in 35 countries. In addition to its 17 iron ore mines in Western Australia that produce material used in steel, its products include aluminum, diamonds, and boron, a component in fertilizer and smartphones. Historically miners have been known for their environmental impact but today are increasingly recognized as crucial players in the transition to green energy. So what is Rio Tinto doing to ramp up production of its critical minerals business and how will China’s economic slowdown impact its iron ore sector? CNBC got a behind the scenes look at Rio Tinto’s Utah operation to find out.
