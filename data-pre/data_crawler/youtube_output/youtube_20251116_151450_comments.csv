But here they have no issue with Rio Tinto palming off thousands of jobs to automation. Skipping wages and payroll tax. And as a business paying even less tax due to investments that displace workers. Which ultimately undermines resource wealth coming back into our lower classes. 

As a self-confessed Sky News follower, tell me you don’t rage about Brisbane being called Meejing on the Mackay airport billboard (even though Sky News COMPLETELY neglected to mention the board rotated between the 2 names). And states there was mass confusion. Which was absolute total and utter crap.

Having said that, they couldn't have done those things if governments in question weren't stupid enough to go along with it.

The Tiwi Point aluminum smelter in New Zealand for example, was sold to the NZ government in the 70's on the basis of providing 2000 jobs to boost the economy.  But what they actually did was convince the NZ government to pay for the construction of an entire hydroelectric dam to power the smelter and then sell them the electricity at a fraction of the actual cost.  

When I look at the resources this company now has I see all the money the NZ government was stupid enough to let them just walk away with.

Rio Tinto Group is a British-Australian multinational company that is the world's second-largest metals and mining corporation (behind BHP).  It was founded in 1873 when a group of investors purchased a mine complex on the Rio Tinto, in Huelva, Spain, from the Spanish government.  It has grown through a long series of mergers and acquisitions.  Although primarily focused on extraction of minerals, it also has significant operations in refining, particularly the refining of bauxite and iron ore.  It has joint head offices in London, England and Melbourne, Australia.

Rio Tinto is a dual-listed company traded on both the London Stock Exchange, where it is a component of the FTSE 100 Index, and the Australian Securities Exchange, where it is a component of the S&P/ASX 200 index.

If copper costs enough for long enough, companies will change their designs.  For instance, communications throughout a vehicle can be multiplexed onto a single pair of wires.  Need more power transmitted on less copper?  Increase the voltage.  Hell, communications can actually be multiplexed onto power lines too!  There are practical limits of course, but we are nowhere near them.

Even the issue of mining enough lithium is solvable.  There is a lot of lithium available, but processing some of it is rather nasty and expensive.  But there is a lot of R&D currenting working on sodium based batteries.  Sodium has more free electrons in its outer valence, meaning one atom could theoretically store more power, offsetting it's higher mass by increasing energy density.  Sodium is incredibly abundant and found in every drop of the ocean water.  Switching to sodium could actually reduce cost and eliminate at least one of the mining bottlenecks in EV adoption.",26,2023-12-02T22:28:50Z,2023-12-02T22:31:20Z,1,False,

Are you sure about that? It appears that American consumers are rejecting EVs. Dealers can no longer sell them. They are stacking up on lots and dealerships are canceling orders left and right. American EV manufacturers are canceling lines like the Ford lightning pickup truck.

Everybody's finally realized that electric vehicles do not have any kind of useful range to them and there's so many more problems and pitfalls associated with them.

In the last year it would appear that Americans are starting to reject electric vehicles so I wouldn't go out on a limb and say there's going to be an electric vehicle boom anytime soon. It seems more like it's going to be an electric vehicle bust..


If electric vehicles were viable and they worked you wouldn't need governments pouring trillions of dollars of subsidies into it. The capitalistic market would automatically bring them to fruition. It isn't going to happen because it doesn't work. At least not at this time with current technology.

Firstly, repurchasing shares in not necessarily a good thing for shareholders.  It very much depends on if the company repurchased shares at above or below intrinsic value. A company that repurchases shares below intrinsic value enhances shareholder value, a company that repurchases shares above intrinsic value destroys shareholder value.

Secondly, purchasing a stock based on its past performance is largely irrelevant.  It’s the future that matters, not the past.  For example, between the two companies Intel and AMD, Intel has historically performed way better than AMD.  However in recent years it has been AMD that has way outperformed Intel.  

Thirdly, you can often make more money from a company that has problems, than a company that has had enormous success.  It really depends upon what price you pay for your investment.",1,2024-06-28T19:32:43Z,2024-06-28T19:32:43Z,0,True,Ugy-R_hD39pHVCSWTEN4AaABAg
