      "description": "Sky News Business Editor Edward Boyd has travelled to Rio Tinto’s Gudai-Darri mine in Western Australia to see the mining corporation's newest and most technologically advanced mine.\n\nThis is the first large-scale media trip Rio Tinto has hosted since the Juukan Gorge scandal – which saw 46,000-year-old aboriginal shelters blown up by the company. \n\nThe $3.1 billion Gudai-Darri mine began its production in 2021 and reached its capacity of 43 million tonnes in less than four months.\n\nRio Tinto plans to invest a further $130 million – expanding the mine's output to 50 million tonnes. \n\nGudai-Darri uses autonomous trucks, drills, water carts and trains – as well as remote control robots that inspect conveyor belts for bearing failures and damage.\n\nThe driverless trucks only stop to be refuelled or serviced.",

      "title": "Why Mining Giant Rio Tinto Is Benefitting From The EV Boom",
      "description": "Copper mines, like this one in Utah, are on the frontline of America’s transition to clean energy. This site, owned and operated by mining giant Rio Tinto, produces roughly 200,000 metric tons of copper annually — with room to grow. Global demand for copper, a major component of EVs, is expected to almost double from 25 million metric tons to nearly 49 million metric tons by 2035. But miners face a multitude of issues as they ramp up production, not least of which includes mitigating environmental damage, addressing the concerns of the local stakeholders, and operating in remote regions of the world. \n\nBased in the UK, Rio Tinto is one of the world’s largest mining companies with projects in 35 countries. In addition to its 17 iron ore mines in Western Australia that produce material used in steel, its products include aluminum, diamonds, and boron, a component in fertilizer and smartphones. Historically miners have been known for their environmental impact but today are increasingly recognized as crucial players in the transition to green energy. So what is Rio Tinto doing to ramp up production of its critical minerals business and how will China’s economic slowdown impact its iron ore sector? CNBC got a behind the scenes look at Rio Tinto’s Utah operation to find out.\n\nChapters:\n0:00-3:02 Intro \n3:02-6:25 Chapter 1 Kennecott\n6:26-8:36 Chapter 2 History \n8:37-10:58 Chapter 3 Mining challenges \n10:59:13:30 Chapter 4 Automation in mining \n\nProduced and Shot by: Shawn Baldwin\nEdited by: Darren Geeter\nSupervising Producer: Jeniece Pettitt\nAdditional Camera: Katie Brigham, Magdalena Petrova\nAnimations: Christina Locopo\nNarrated by: Robert Ferris\nAdditional Footage: Getty Images, Rio Tinto\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

But here they have no issue with Rio Tinto palming off thousands of jobs to automation. Skipping wages and payroll tax. And as a business paying even less tax due to investments that displace workers. Which ultimately undermines resource wealth coming back into our lower classes. \n\nAs a self-confessed Sky News follower, tell me you don’t rage about Brisbane being called Meejing on the Mackay airport billboard (even though Sky News COMPLETELY neglected to mention the board rotated between the 2 names). And states there was mass confusion. Which was absolute total and utter crap. This is literally the first Sky News report I’ve watched that just simply states facts without putting their personal/ often biased opinion into a news piece 😂",

The reason they are so big is because of all the manipulative and deceptive tactics they have used with their multinational agreements.  \n\nHaving said that, they couldn't have done those things if governments in question weren't stupid enough to go along with it.\n\nThe Tiwi Point aluminum smelter in New Zealand for example, was sold to the NZ government in the 70's on the basis of providing 2000 jobs to boost the economy.  But what they actually did was convince the NZ government to pay for the construction of an entire hydroelectric dam to power the smelter and then sell them the electricity at a fraction of the actual cost.  \n\nWhen I look at the resources this company now has I see all the money the NZ government was stupid enough to let them just walk away with.\n\nAnd when a company has an attitude like that in one area of their operation you can be damn sue it infests everything else as well including how they treat their employees.",

      "text": "You're not very well informed, and apparently you are unable to perform the most basic of internet searches:\n\nRio Tinto Group is a British-Australian multinational company that is the world's second-largest metals and mining corporation (behind BHP).  It was founded in 1873 when a group of investors purchased a mine complex on the Rio Tinto, in Huelva, Spain, from the Spanish government.  It has grown through a long series of mergers and acquisitions.  Although primarily focused on extraction of minerals, it also has significant operations in refining, particularly the refining of bauxite and iron ore.  It has joint head offices in London, England and Melbourne, Australia.\n\nRio Tinto is a dual-listed company traded on both the London Stock Exchange, where it is a component of the FTSE 100 Index, and the Australian Securities Exchange, where it is a component of the S&P/ASX 200 index.  American depositary shares of Rio Tinto's British branch are also traded on the New York Stock Exchange.",

In 2022, the people rebelled, so the Serbian government had to legally stop the project, but you still insist. You paid a Swiss \"student\" to make a documentary about the problem, which presented these people as savages and you presented that film in the EU Parliament. These people came to the presentation of the film, and by lobbying you forbade them to give a speech! You won't dig in Serbia! We promise you this",

      "text": "There are engineering solutions that can drastically reduce copper requirements.  If copper costs enough for long enough, companies will change their designs.  For instance, communications throughout a vehicle can be multiplexed onto a single pair of wires.  Need more power transmitted on less copper?  Increase the voltage.  Hell, communications can actually be multiplexed onto power lines too!  There are practical limits of course, but we are nowhere near them.\n\nEven the issue of mining enough lithium is solvable.  There is a lot of lithium available, but processing some of it is rather nasty and expensive.  But there is a lot of R&D currenting working on sodium based batteries.  Sodium has more free electrons in its outer valence, meaning one atom could theoretically store more power, offsetting it's higher mass by increasing energy density.  Sodium is incredibly abundant and found in every drop of the ocean water.  Switching to sodium could actually reduce cost and eliminate at least one of the mining bottlenecks in EV adoption.",

Journalism, especially investigative has killed many a giant. \nBut, your comment still stands. In this media driven age of inane soundbites and slick visuals, so called journalism, mainstream journalism, has become a giant marketing and pr machine for business.\nJust thinking about the recent sbf/ftx saga. Mainstream media really helped raise the profile of Sam BF, and were then there to comprehensively report on his spectacular demise. \nI actually really like cnbc, I have watched a lot of their stuff on YouTube, and found many of their videos to be interesting and informative, although, I will admit, that some of their stuff really does fall into the fluff piece/promotional category of 'journalism'.\nYeah, it's a good point you've made.

It really is one of the better choices for having a mine for copper etc.  Wasatch watershed is not drinkable unless its from the mountains and the actual mines themselves are in the mountains on the eastern side of the frontal range is it is highly unlikely to cause polution that is a problem for the general populace.  The bigger issue is the smelting of the material and that I agree is a problem giving how air tends to stay stale in the valley without an storm front moving through which doesn't really happen much in the summer.",

Should be similar for many 19th century South African Companies I would imagine.\nWith serious mining operations, its usually always those big holes to help with safety, environmental runoff, and efficiency. For instance, if a major mining company could get a foothold in the Congo, there would be a big hole rather than locals digging small channels. The big hole would have less problems for the local population for things like heavy metal contamination of the water supply.\nAt the end of the day, any mining operation will be a tradeoff of the benefits it creates verse the damage. If the world is serious about EVs, then this would be the damage that's been deemed acceptable.",

And actually if you're mining on the top of a mountain, the mining can actually generate electricity by letting the movement of ores off the mountain and into the valleys to generate electricity. We need to mine a lot of resources to shift the economy and mining locally is better than trying to get resources out of hostile countries in the middle east. Also, eventually, because most of the contents of an EV are highly recyclable, the loop will close and significantly less mining will be needed. That'll take decades though as the first generations of EVs are still on the roads.",

      "text": "Rio Tinto's Kennecott copper mine in Utah, the second largest copper mine in the US, produces around 200,000 metric tons of copper annually. Global demand for copper is expected to almost double by 2035, as copper is a major component of electric vehicles. However, the mining industry faces environmental challenges and concerns from local stakeholders while operating in remote locations. As a crucial player in the transition to green energy, Rio Tinto invested more than $2bn to modernise the Kennecott mine and facilities and is trying to open an underground copper mine 60 miles east of Phoenix. Rio Tinto is one of the world's largest mining companies with projects in 35 countries, producing materials such as iron ore, aluminum, diamonds, boron, and copper. Renewable power systems such as wind and solar are at least five times more copper intensive than conventional power, and to meet that demand, Rio Tinto is ramping up production of its critical minerals business. The company is hoping to increase its copper production by 30 to 40% over the next five years and potentially build one of the top ten copper mines in the world.",

These companies, which are mainly British, now control an identified $1.05 trillion worth of resources in Africa in just five commodities — oil, gold, diamonds, coal and platinum. Of the 101 LSE-listed companies, one quarter are incorporated in tax havens. A determination to plunder the natural resources of Africa is taking place, with the active support of the British government; this is contributing significantly to a net drain of resources from Africa, already the world’s poorest continent.",

Dealers can no longer sell them. They are stacking up on lots and dealerships are canceling orders left and right. American EV manufacturers are canceling lines like the Ford lightning pickup truck.\n\nEverybody's finally realized that electric vehicles do not have any kind of useful range to them and there's so many more problems and pitfalls associated with them.\n\nIn the last year it would appear that Americans are starting to reject electric vehicles so I wouldn't go out on a limb and say there's going to be an electric vehicle boom anytime soon. It seems more like it's going to be an electric vehicle bust..\n\n\nIf electric vehicles were viable and they worked you wouldn't need governments pouring trillions of dollars of subsidies into it. The capitalistic market would automatically bring them to fruition. It isn't going to happen because it doesn't work. At least not at this time with current technology.\n\nI don't care what the dictator of California Gavin newsom says about no more gas vehicles after 2035. I guarantee you I bet you a million dollars said in 2035 they will still have to sell gas vehicles in California.",

There have been at least four significant bailouts of large Australian businesses this year, particularly in the heavy industry sector, due to economic pressures like high energy costs. Notable examples include a large support package for the Whyalla steelworks, a bailout for Nyrstar's smelters, government investment in lithium miner Liontown Resources, and a support package for Glencore's Mt Isa smelter. Industrial plants are being forced to close because the gas they need to run all goes offshore. Australia is ranked 105th out of 145 on the global complexity index, which is a measure of the complexity and productive capabilities of a country. This is both appalling and disgraceful for a western democracy that has prided itself innovation and productivity. Doing business in Australia has become impossible. The only winners are the mining giants, none of whom pay royalties, and property tycoons who are monopolising the housing market.",

      "text": "Interesting analysis.  There are two comments I would make.  Firstly, repurchasing shares in not necessarily a good thing for shareholders.  It very much depends on if the company repurchased shares at above or below intrinsic value. A company that repurchases shares below intrinsic value enhances shareholder value, a company that repurchases shares above intrinsic value destroys shareholder value.\n\nSecondly, purchasing a stock based on its past performance is largely irrelevant.  It’s the future that matters, not the past.  For example, between the two companies Intel and AMD, Intel has historically performed way better than AMD.  However in recent years it has been AMD that has way outperformed Intel.  \n\nThirdly, you can often make more money from a company that has problems, than a company that has had enormous success.  It really depends upon what price you pay for your investment.",
