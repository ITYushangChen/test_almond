Rio Tinto and BHP in Canada at least don’t pay as well as some of the smaller players like conuma, teck or capstone copper in the us. Except for the prestige of those big companies they don’t bring much to the table. I recently began think except for the name of these companies what benefits do they have on your career as an engineer in mining enough to take a lower pay. Sure the benefits are good but those small companies pay OT for their engineers maybe not teck. \n\n*I know this is heavily mine dependent since the culture of the mine influences operation more than the owner.\n\n*I also heard bad things about conuma’s toxic culture I get it but the pay especially with OT is amazing for engineers\n\nIs it just me or does it seem like working for these majors are way overrated? \n",

You also know there's a good chance she wasn't the best applicant and she will be treated as a diversity hire on site.

The bulk of the men will just assume a woman is there because of her extra x chromosome and nothing more. \n\nTargets lower morale and devalue the people you proport to value.\n\nOn the other hand Rio thinks it will make them look good and we will forget about the massive polution and environmental destruction and the destruction of ancient aboriginal sites.

Depending on your luck, you may not have a senior to work with you for your first 3 months, which will be spent on a non business value electronic greeting/networking/clubs/hobbies system. Nobody uses these systems and it exists just to keep you busy.\n\nEventually you should be put into a proper development team, like your luckier peers. However the quality of your development lead and scrum master may vary.\n\nSome will never interact with you at all, and expect you to resolve all your work yourself. Production incidents will occur and your scrum master will reprioritize your work, only to yell at you when your original work is not completed by the original deadline.\n\nThis abuse extends beyond juniors, extending towards seniors, where the entire team is too afraid to call out abuse, as they too have been abuse for raising issues.\n\n**Sexual assault towards younger women**\n\nIf you're a young girl, expect sexual assault. Juniors and seniors will touch you without consent. If you raise this with management, they will say, \"this is due to cultural differences and you should be more inclusive\".\n\nI know 5 cases just within our department within the last 2 months. You're not any safer in a city office than you are on site.\n\n**Not enough work**\n\nThere is a lot of work, however nobody is willing to pay for it. Most of this work is outside the capabilities of a junior too. If you shomehow do manage to go onto a product, hope your lead developer is helpful.\n\nCurrently we have a bunch of juniors and seniors who mess around as they have no work to do. One guy just plays chess on his phone for most of the day while he waits for his project allocation.\n\n**Forced into roles you lack training for**\n\nNon programmers are forced to do programming, despite hiring making it clear you will not be in a software development role. When raising the issue with management, they will tell you to \"keep an open mind\".\n\n**Closing thoughts**\n\nIf you somehow manage to withstand all this, the money is very good, and there are opportunities to learn cool things. You just need to be proactive to find these opportunities. Eventually however you will need to switch departments or companies to expand your skill set.\n\nStaying here long term as a software developer is career suicide, as you don't work on complex tasks or with new technology.",

      "post_selftext": "\n\nThe whole mood around the pit yesterday was solemn. Nobody talked, openly at least, about the man who killed himself, whom I’ll refer to from this point forward as John. The news of his suicide spread like wildfire among the community hours after it happened, but it didn’t make any news stories. In fact, it didn’t make anything at all. Even his daughter, whom is avid about Facebook and Twitter, was tight-lipped about it online. For all intents and purposes, there was no record of him having died at all as far as we could tell.\n\nWork went about in a normal capacity, and someone had even taken up John’s job seamlessly. It was as if he’d never been there in the first place.\n\nIt was around lunch time that something changed.\n\nTim, the man who’d told me the story from my previous post, sat down across form me in the cafeteria. This, in itself, wasn’t that strange – we’d eaten lunch before, often with John and a handful of other people – but it was the conversation he struck almost immediately after sitting down.\n\nHis voice was hurried, shaken, and he spoke in a low tone that was almost a whisper.\n\n“I’m going down there,” he said.\n\nI didn’t reply. At first, I wasn’t honestly sure what it was he was talking about, but it dawned on me at the exact moment he continued to speak.\n\n“I’m going down to the bottom of the pit. John used to work close to the bottom – he actually KNEW the guy that I told you about yesterday that went crazy – and he almost never talked about it. I got the impression he saw or heard something he shouldn’t and that he was honestly afraid of the things going on down the mine. If he killed himself, which I’m not convinced it was as plain as that, I think he did it because he was scared. He had a lot to live for, but whatever he knew was either too dangerous for him to stay alive, or too terrifying for him to want to continue living.”\n\nI didn’t say anything for a moment after that, but instead let what he said hang in the air between us like the blade of a guillotine. Although I hadn’t said it outright to Tim, I believed we shared the same feeling that whomever was running the mine had more control over our lives than we cared for. If he crossed them, he would be vaporized from existence – and me along with him. Simply being a part of the conversation that was happening was enough, I think, to merit action by the upper echelons. The moment he sat down, hell, maybe even the moment we met in the Filling Station, our lives were already in danger.\n\nI agreed to help him.\n\nThere was no point in waiting to carry out the plan that Tim had devised. Being that we were likely already on the radar, waiting even 24 hours could mean that one or both of us would go missing before carrying out the plan.\n\nTim’s plan was simple, really, and it started with me feigning a stomach ache. I was so nervous it wasn’t hard to force myself to throw up, and after making a mess all over the dirt, I was sent home by my supervisor.\n\nI drove nearly home, just as Tim instructed, then double-backed up the highway and turned my radio to the channel I was told.\n\nHe’d been very specific on where I should wait to hear from him. It was a few miles down a dirt road in Herriman. I knew what he’d been planning to do, but I didn’t believe he’d actually do it until I saw the dust being kicked up on the other side of a hill.\n\nOne of the big Kennecott trucks – the kind that goes down to the bottom of the mine and drives through the tunnels – came up and over the hill with Tim in the driver’s seat. I sat in my truck, watching as he drove the truck past the road where I sat and up a small canyon.\n\nIn the years that he’d worked for the mine, he’d made some friends, as he put it, and those friends had managed to get him the keys to one of the trucks that he’d otherwise need special clearance to drive.\n\nI heard his voice on the radio then, and I nearly jumped out of my skin.\n\n“You there?”\n\nI told him I was.\n\n“Keep the channel open, and don’t use my name. I’m going to report to you what I see as I go down this tunnel. No matter what happens to me, I want you to share with everyone what I tell you. Understand?”\n\nI told him I did.\n\nThe next forty-five minutes was completely silent. I sat and played games on my phone and listened to music, but I couldn’t help the knot forming in my stomach. I thought for a moment that perhaps I didn’t actually fake being sick. I was hot and feverish from the anxiety and my stomach bile felt like it was going to burn a hole right through me.\n\nWhen the voice came over the radio again, I’d almost begun to give up hope that he’d made it.\n\n“I’m in.”\n\nFrom this point forward, as requested by Tim, I will transcribe everything that was said over the radio.\n\nTIM: I’m in the tunnel now. They searched the truck and let me in. I passed two of those guard dogs they talk about on the signs in the lower tunnels. They’re big fuckers – I wouldn’t want to be on the wrong end of them.\n\nI don’t think they’ve been mining these tunnels. There are huge veins of copper and gold that don’t look like they’ll ever be excavated. I think they’re working on getting deeper into the mountains.\n\nSILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES\n\nTIM: I just saw a caution sign, sort of like the one in the pit, but this one is different. It says:\n\nCAUTION\n\nGloves and protective masks must be worn from this point forward. Under no circumstances are you to remove them.\n\nAll fossils and artifacts must be reported immediately upon excavation.\n\nRio Tinto accepts no responsibility for any physical, mental, or emotional damage past this point. \n\nSILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES\n\nTIM: I’m still in the truck and I’ve reached a big room. I’ve got a mask and gloves from the cab of the truck. I’m gonna get out and take a look here.\n\nIt looks sort of like a bomb shelter. There are these barrels that look like whiskey barrels all over the place. I think they’re Cedar maybe.\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever seen a vein of copper this big. It’s like they dug the room out of the stuff. The walls and everything are almost all completely unrefined copper.\n\nI can’t seem to open any of the barrels, but there’s something weird about them. I feel warm, but not on the outside.\n\nSILENCE FOR APPROXIMATELY TEN MINUTES\n\nTIM: Someone’s following me. I can hear them talking to me. They know my name.\n\nSILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES\n\nTIM: I’m trying to come out now, but he won’t stop following me. He wants me to take off my helmet.\n\nSILENCE\n\nI’m going to take off my helmet.\n\nME: Don’t take off your helmet! I’m on my way.\n\nSILENCE\n\n*Inaudible audio*\n\nNote: Tim began to speak in another voice here. I could hear his voice in it, but I do not believe that it was him speaking. I believe it was something or someone else speaking THROUGH him.\n\nVOICE: Come unto me.\n\nME: What was that?\n\nVOICE: Come unto me my child and partake of the manna of heaven. For with it, ye shall know everlasting life.\n\nTIM: *Crying* I will. I will.\n\nME: Get out of there!\n\nVOICE: Timothy. Look upon me and see.\n\nTIM: Screaming.\n\nVOICE: Do you believe in God?\n\nRADIO STATIC.\n\nSILENCE.\n\n \n\nI haven’t seen or heard from Tim since then.\n\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6mmzxz/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecot_copper_mine/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6nayvc/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecot_copper_mine/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6o24nv/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecott_copper_mine/)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6ob1fm/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecott_copper_mine/)\n",

      "post_selftext": "The whole mood around the pit yesterday was solemn. Nobody talked, openly at least, about the man who killed himself, whom I’ll refer to from this point forward as John. The news of his suicide spread like wildfire among the community hours after it happened, but it didn’t make any news stories. In fact, it didn’t make anything at all. Even his daughter, whom is avid about Facebook and Twitter, was tight-lipped about it online. For all intents and purposes, there was no record of him having died at all as far as we could tell.\n\nWork went about in a normal capacity, and someone had even taken up John’s job seamlessly. It was as if he’d never been there in the first place.\n\nIt was around lunch time that something changed.\n\nTim, the man who’d told me the story from my previous post, sat down across form me in the cafeteria. This, in itself, wasn’t that strange – we’d eaten lunch before, often with John and a handful of other people – but it was the conversation he struck almost immediately after sitting down.\n\nHis voice was hurried, shaken, and he spoke in a low tone that was almost a whisper.\n\n“I’m going down there,” he said.\n\nI didn’t reply. At first, I wasn’t honestly sure what it was he was talking about, but it dawned on me at the exact moment he continued to speak.\n\n“I’m going down to the bottom of the pit. John used to work close to the bottom – he actually KNEW the guy that I told you about yesterday that went crazy – and he almost never talked about it. I got the impression he saw or heard something he shouldn’t and that he was honestly afraid of the things going on down the mine. If he killed himself, which I’m not convinced it was as plain as that, I think he did it because he was scared. He had a lot to live for, but whatever he knew was either too dangerous for him to stay alive, or too terrifying for him to want to continue living.”\n\nI didn’t say anything for a moment after that, but instead let what he said hang in the air between us like the blade of a guillotine. Although I hadn’t said it outright to Tim, I believed we shared the same feeling that whomever was running the mine had more control over our lives than we cared for. If he crossed them, he would be vaporized from existence – and me along with him. Simply being a part of the conversation that was happening was enough, I think, to merit action by the upper echelons. The moment he sat down, hell, maybe even the moment we met in the Filling Station, our lives were already in danger.\n\nI agreed to help him.\n\nThere was no point in waiting to carry out the plan that Tim had devised. Being that we were likely already on the radar, waiting even 24 hours could mean that one or both of us would go missing before carrying out the plan.\n\nTim’s plan was simple, really, and it started with me feigning a stomach ache. I was so nervous it wasn’t hard to force myself to throw up, and after making a mess all over the dirt, I was sent home by my supervisor.\n\nI drove nearly home, just as Tim instructed, then double-backed up the highway and turned my radio to the channel I was told.\n\nHe’d been very specific on where I should wait to hear from him. It was a few miles down a dirt road in Herriman. I knew what he’d been planning to do, but I didn’t believe he’d actually do it until I saw the dust being kicked up on the other side of a hill.\n\nOne of the big Kennecott trucks – the kind that goes down to the bottom of the mine and drives through the tunnels – came up and over the hill with Tim in the driver’s seat. I sat in my truck, watching as he drove the truck past the road where I sat and up a small canyon.\n\nIn the years that he’d worked for the mine, he’d made some friends, as he put it, and those friends had managed to get him the keys to one of the trucks that he’d otherwise need special clearance to drive.\n\nI heard his voice on the radio then, and I nearly jumped out of my skin.\n\n“You there?”\n\nI told him I was.\n\n“Keep the channel open, and don’t use my name. I’m going to report to you what I see as I go down this tunnel. No matter what happens to me, I want you to share with everyone what I tell you. Understand?”\n\nI told him I did.\n\nThe next forty-five minutes was completely silent. I sat and played games on my phone and listened to music, but I couldn’t help the knot forming in my stomach. I thought for a moment that perhaps I didn’t actually fake being sick. I was hot and feverish from the anxiety and my stomach bile felt like it was going to burn a hole right through me.\n\nWhen the voice came over the radio again, I’d almost begun to give up hope that he’d made it.\n\n“I’m in.”\n\nFrom this point forward, as requested by Tim, I will transcribe everything that was said over the radio.\n\nTIM: I’m in the tunnel now. They searched the truck and let me in. I passed two of those guard dogs they talk about on the signs in the lower tunnels. They’re big fuckers – I wouldn’t want to be on the wrong end of them.\n\nI don’t think they’ve been mining these tunnels. There are huge veins of copper and gold that don’t look like they’ll ever be excavated. I think they’re working on getting deeper into the mountains.\n\nSILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES\n\nTIM: I just saw a caution sign, sort of like the one in the pit, but this one is different. It says:\n\nCAUTION\n\nGloves and protective masks must be worn from this point forward. Under no circumstances are you to remove them.\n\nAll fossils and artifacts must be reported immediately upon excavation.\n\nRio Tinto accepts no responsibility for any physical, mental, or emotional damage past this point. \n\nSILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES\n\nTIM: I’m still in the truck and I’ve reached a big room. I’ve got a mask and gloves from the cab of the truck. I’m gonna get out and take a look here.\n\nIt looks sort of like a bomb shelter. There are these barrels that look like whiskey barrels all over the place. I think they’re Cedar maybe.\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever seen a vein of copper this big. It’s like they dug the room out of the stuff. The walls and everything are almost all completely unrefined copper.\n\nI can’t seem to open any of the barrels, but there’s something weird about them. I feel warm, but not on the outside.\n\nSILENCE FOR APPROXIMATELY TEN MINUTES\n\nTIM: Someone’s following me. I can hear them talking to me. They know my name.\n\nSILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES\n\nTIM: I’m trying to come out now, but he won’t stop following me. He wants me to take off my helmet.\n\nSILENCE\n\nI’m going to take off my helmet.\n\nME: Don’t take off your helmet! I’m on my way.\n\nSILENCE\n\n*Inaudible audio*\n\nNote: Tim began to speak in another voice here. I could hear his voice in it, but I do not believe that it was him speaking. I believe it was something or someone else speaking THROUGH him.\n\nVOICE: Come unto me.\n\nME: What was that?\n\nVOICE: Come unto me my child and partake of the manna of heaven. For with it, ye shall know everlasting life.\n\nTIM: *Crying* I will. I will.\n\nME: Get out of there!\n\nVOICE: Timothy. Look upon me and see.\n\nTIM: Screaming.\n\nVOICE: Do you believe in God?\n\nRADIO STATIC.\n\nSILENCE.\n\n \n\nI haven’t seen or heard from Tim since then.\n\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6mmzxz/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecot_copper_mine/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6nayvc/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecot_copper_mine/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6o24nv/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecott_copper_mine/)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6ob1fm/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecott_copper_mine/)",

      "post_selftext": "Hello, I'm sure this has been posted before, I appreciate any additional info\n\nI'm currently27 years of age at a local community college in British Columbia taking Millwright Foundations, and previously I was working at a sawmill for a year doing clean-up / Sparkwatch. \n\nI took the oiler apprenticeship test through my local sawmill and failed by two questions overall. It was kind of disheartening, but I decided to go take the program through my local community college as honestly I didn't have a huge understanding of trade work in general, and I had some free time due to layoff at a lot of the sawmills in BC, mine included. I've learned a lot since I started in February, and my graduation is coming up soon. I'll be more than likely landing an overall mark of 85%.\n\nI have family and friends who also live in Kitimat near Rio Tinto Alcan / LNG, so it wouldn't be to difficult to move if need-be. I'd also move anywhere in BC that wasn't too much further north than I already am. Depending on the job of course.\n\nRecently, the sawmill has stated they were opening up again soon, and they are looking to hire me on as a level 1 millwright, @ $38.75 / hour. 7am - 3:30pm, M-W(24 hours a week) for now, schedule likely to change as production ramps up. I am having a bit of concern as the job industry for sawmills seems to be up and down, and I don't really want to be stuck in that loop. They also don't have a great deal of red seal millwrights, and I really want to get the best opportunity to learn that I can. They often open and close during the Christmas months, log shortages combined with extremely cold weather on an old mill that hasn't been updated in years.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is, does anyone have recommendations here? \n\nIs joining the BC Millwright union my best bet, and claiming EI till I can find employment?(I didn't collect it as I went to school, so I'm still entitled to around 15 weeks. after I've finished school if I haven't started working), or should I go to the sawmill, and start my millwright apprenticeship and see where the mill goes, if it ends up closing or keeping production going?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Go back to an old sawmill to start Level 1 apprenticeship, or go through with the BC millwright union and hope for a better opportunity.",

      "post_selftext": "[https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/9064167/jenna-price-anu-in-crisis-the-overhaul-it-needs-now](https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/9064167/jenna-price-anu-in-crisis-the-overhaul-it-needs-now)\n\nBy Jenna Price\n\nSeptember 11 2025 - 4:35pm\n\nHow is it that one of our most beloved institutions, the Australian National University, is so poorly run?\n\nHow is it that we discover, a minute into the new vice-chancellor Genevieve Bell’s tenure that hundreds of staff would need to be sacked? Courses cancelled. Research abandoned.\n\nLet me tell you how.\n\nThe governing body of the ANU is a complete shitshow. But this national treasure is not alone.\n\nThe governance of universities in this country needs a colonoscopy, resection and reconstruction.\n\nThe good news is that the minister Jason Clare could step in at ANU because that university is the only one firmly in the federal remit within its own specific legislation, the ANU Act.\n\nBell resigned on Thursday, days into white-hot anticipation about when she would finally relent.\n\nBetween the onset of the anticipation and the announcement were hours and hours and days and days of negotiation of how much she would get to leave. What would be the deal?\n\nThe speculation about whether Julie Bishop would go too hasn’t yet subsided – despite the former foreign minister’s firm announcement at an all-staff town hall that she wasn’t going anywhere.\n\nShe’s hanging on for dear life. She must find it hard to go from institution to institution, knowing she isn’t wanted.\n\nBut as multiple people tell me across the university, it’s not really about Bishop or Bell.\n\nThere are just shocking symptoms of a system that’s stuffed. It appears that no one in senior management at the university understands it needs to listen to those who make up the heart and soul of what was once our leading university.\n\nThis is not Rio Tinto or BHP. Universities are a public good and those in charge need to understand that holy responsibility.\n\nAnd a word to the wise. When you appoint a vice-chancellor, it needs to be an academic who is a people person.\n\nThat may sound trite, but the ability to relate to those you lead is crucial. I’d argue that’s their main job, to connect with staff and students. Of course, that person also functions as the chief executive officer – but we see across some universities that they handle the juggle much better than others. Take, for example, Attila Brungs now at UNSW and formerly at UTS. He could make tough decisions but was never a monster.\n\nThe problems at ANU extend well beyond individuals, beyond the Bishops and the Bells.\n\n“There is an overall consensus that we must have more accountability, more transparency, and more involvement of staff,” says Carolyn Hendricks, professor at the Crawford School of Public Policy.\n\nShe is part of a university-wide solution to the current debacle, what students and staff call the ANU Governance Project.\n\nHendricks describes it as bottom-up, conversations, kitchen table chats, governance workshops. It began in August and already Bishop has had to sign on to at least listen to what the people say. Let’s see how that pans out.\n\nHendricks, an expert in democratic governance, says: “We’ve experienced incoherent decision making – Renew ANU \\[The university’s own change management process\\] is running endless consultations but it’s been along the lines of: ‘here’s what we are planning. Give us feedback on the wallpaper while we dismantle the house’.”\n\nThe ANU has so many internal experts, you’d wonder why they couldn’t engage some of those in this hideous process. Marija Taflaga, an academic at ANU who has undertaken research fellowships at both the Australian Parliamentary Library and the Australian Museum of Democracy and has a clutch of ARC grants, says the ANU Act has to shift.\n\n“We must change the way the nominations committee to council is constituted, to include both staff and students as a matter of law,” she says.\n\nRight now, it is entirely controlled by the chancellor. Taflaga is also calling on the minister to establish a university senate that will facilitate a proper accountability chain from staff and students and the public all the way through to council and university managers.\n\nOne of the leaders of the ANU Governance Project, Jessie Moritz, an expert on authoritarian governance, was at the town hall meeting on Thursday where Bishop told staff she would listen to what the project says.\n\n“She will be supporting us as we engage with council. This is an excellent step forward for governance at ANU,” says Moritz.\n\n“We could change everyone at the top but we would still need systems change.”\n\nCan Bishop oversee meaningful change? Now that’s a story for a few months down the track.\n\n *Jenna Price is a Canberra Times columnist and a visiting fellow at the Australian National University.*",

      "post_title": "Working with Australia's mining giant",
      "post_selftext": "  \n\nI'm writing this post for people interested in working in the mining industry. There are a few things that I guess are no secret to anyone, like usually, the mining sites are remote and hard to get places, or the industry, in general, is not the best work for the environment (no one can't deny our heavy reliance on the sector). \n\n*A quick disclaimer: this post is my personal experience in the sector, and I understand other people might have an opposite experience and therefore disagree with my opinion*.\n\n **Part 1:**\n\nSince graduating from university, I have always wanted to work in the mining sector. Still, II found it very hard to find a way in (I was particular about the type of role I was looking for, and I won't really be open to any role). This went on for a few years, and I got busy with my work and building my career (in construction and engineering). After about 17 years, I got an opportunity to join the mining giant RIO TINTO. At first, I was very excited. The role seems very exciting, with many responsibilities, and the team looks very helpful and caring (at least on the surface). So, I have quite a senior position in the construction industry and a demotion to join Rio, but I was confident this would lead to fast promotion and a great life. \n\nWe packed up from a lovely house in Perth to a small community in Pilbara where 10 months of the year, the temperature is between **35 and 55 Celsius**; where you need to make a weekend plan for grocery shopping as it will take 180km around the trip. And fuel price is more than $2.70 at the time when you can easily find deasil in Perth for around $1.80. \n\nAfter finishing 4 days of online training, I showed up to work, I can honestly say I was so naive and assumed the number of care people showing was genuine, but it’s all on the surface. Many long-timers learn to put on a show; that’s the general working culture. \n\nOn the first day, my supervisor (although the common term Rio people love to use is their leader, I came to the conclusion that half of these people didn’t even deserve to work, let alone be called a leader, so I stuck with supervisor) inform me that the role I was hired for getting redundant and I would be promoted to the manager level in few months, so naturally, this added to my excitement, as this was a proof that I needed to believe I made a right decision and move. So I work on learning the Rio convo (in Rio, they literally have RioPedia, which is a 45 page double-sided single, spaced booklet of Rio’s acronym, and that’s all they talk about, first 4 weeks of attending meetings (and in the Rio, there is a lot of them, approximately 9 meetings every day, all these meetings are set across the business starts at the same time cross all mine sites,  you have to talk about the same topics across all sites) I had no idea what are they talking about, and what is actually going on. To make the matter even more fun, on week 2, I was instructed that I needed to chair the daily SPM (site performance meeting). Naturally, you would think there is support in helping me transition to my role and support to succeed; my success is my supervisor’s success, but all that is just a simple lie and total BS in Rio. Honestly, I can talk about this for hours. \n\nAnyway, after a few months, my supervisor informed me that it was decided that instead of automatic transition to the new manager role, I  need to submit my application for the new position (but it is all formality, and the role is mine anyway), so I continue to work on the KPIs that she set for me, and build the team that I didn’t have while continuing to learn this giant beast of organisation, after approximately 9 months from my start date she informed me that not only the job is mine automatic, but I have to complete for it like everyone else. I will go through the entire Rio interview process again with a panel that she is not part of, and I only have 48 hours to prepare as the interview is in 2 days.",

I know right now the career advisor is sending emails promoting people use transferable skills, which sounds good to start, but I feel like some employers just laugh at Games even if students know programming, UI/UX, project management, etc. There's suppose to be someone that supposedly promote the program to employers but not sure how that role is really going.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ubehbk1itrdf1.png?width=2708&format=png&auto=webp&s=16b0235361acf795116ea7768c72e9eff8f7c92c",

      "post_selftext": "Hi, I am a geologist with 5 years of experience. I went to a couple different schools for undergrad. Santa Barbara City College has an amazing program for those looking for a cheap program with a ton of field trips and a field course before you transfer to a 4-year school. I transferred to Northern Arizona University, and graduated from there with just your basic geology degree. While in school I did a thesis on carbonate sediments in the Nankai trough subduction zone, but other than that I did nothing really outstanding in school. \n\nRegardless, I got a short-term position with Geotemps at the grand canyon right after school. I was hired to classify something like 2000 mineral samples that the park had confiscated from a guy who had been stealing from one of the old copper mines in the park. I spent aboout 9 months living at the Grand Canyon going through these incredibly rare minerals/possibly \"new\" minerals and trying to figure out what they were/classify them/ organize them for the archives. I also supplemented my income by doing lectures on the formation of the Grand Canyon to tour buses. It was an awesome summer.\n\nThen, while working there, I got hired for my current project. It is copper-moly mine that is proposed to open sometime in the next 10-15 years. It will be an underground block-cave mine, and I am part of the shaping team. This prospect is owned by Rio Tinto. I won't mention the name of the mine, and there are some things I won't be able to answer because I'm not sanctioned by work to write about this- but you can figure out which prospect it is pretty easily from the details I have given. There is a website if you want to find out more about the project. Personally, I do a lot of logging core, sampling management, presentations of findings, etc. Standard stuff.\n\nFinally, lately I have been exploring opportunities for side businesses/ outside advancement opportunities in geology. To that end, I made a website to try to provide geologists with information. The site is professionalgeo.com, feel free to check it out although it's still a work in progress. I just felt frustrated with the attitude of \"oh well to get promoted you just wait 20 years\". Also, I've never taken the ASBOG, so that is going to be my study site too.\n\nSorry this got so long...I'll be answering questions all week...Ask me anything!",

      "post_title": "Working with Australia's mining giant",
      "post_selftext": "  \n\nI'm writing this post for people interested in working in the mining industry. There are a few things that I guess are no secret to anyone, like usually, the mining sites are remote and hard to get places, or the industry, in general, is not the best work for the environment (no one can't deny our heavy reliance on the sector). \n\n*A quick disclaimer: this post is my personal experience in the sector, and I understand other people might have an opposite experience and therefore disagree with my opinion*.\n\n **Part 1:**\n\nSince graduating from university, I have always wanted to work in the mining sector. Still, II found it very hard to find a way in (I was particular about the type of role I was looking for, and I won't really be open to any role). This went on for a few years, and I got busy with my work and building my career (in construction and engineering). After about 17 years, I got an opportunity to join the mining giant RIO TINTO. At first, I was very excited. The role seems very exciting, with many responsibilities, and the team looks very helpful and caring (at least on the surface). So, I have quite a senior position in the construction industry and a demotion to join Rio, but I was confident this would lead to fast promotion and a great life. \n\nWe packed up from a lovely house in Perth to a small community in Pilbara where 10 months of the year, the temperature is between **35 and 55 Celsius**; where you need to make a weekend plan for grocery shopping as it will take 180km around the trip. And fuel price is more than $2.70 at the time when you can easily find deasil in Perth for around $1.80. \n\nAfter finishing 4 days of online training, I showed up to work, I can honestly say I was so naive and assumed the number of care people showing was genuine, but it’s all on the surface. Many long-timers learn to put on a show; that’s the general working culture. \n\nOn the first day, my supervisor (although the common term Rio people love to use is their leader, I came to the conclusion that half of these people didn’t even deserve to work, let alone be called a leader, so I stuck with supervisor) inform me that the role I was hired for getting redundant and I would be promoted to the manager level in few months, so naturally, this added to my excitement, as this was a proof that I needed to believe I made a right decision and move. So I work on learning the Rio convo (in Rio, they literally have RioPedia, which is a 45 page double-sided single, spaced booklet of Rio’s acronym, and that’s all they talk about, first 4 weeks of attending meetings (and in the Rio, there is a lot of them, approximately 9 meetings every day, all these meetings are set across the business starts at the same time cross all mine sites,  you have to talk about the same topics across all sites) I had no idea what are they talking about, and what is actually going on. To make the matter even more fun, on week 2, I was instructed that I needed to chair the daily SPM (site performance meeting). Naturally, you would think there is support in helping me transition to my role and support to succeed; my success is my supervisor’s success, but all that is just a simple lie and total BS in Rio. Honestly, I can talk about this for hours. \n\nAnyway, after a few months, my supervisor informed me that it was decided that instead of automatic transition to the new manager role, I  need to submit my application for the new position (but it is all formality, and the role is mine anyway), so I continue to work on the KPIs that she set for me, and build the team that I didn’t have while continuing to learn this giant beast of organisation, after approximately 9 months from my start date she informed me that not only the job is mine automatic, but I have to complete for it like everyone else. I will go through the entire Rio interview process again with a panel that she is not part of, and I only have 48 hours to prepare as the interview is in 2 days.",

This war has no clearly defined objective, no timelines and no exit strategy.\n\nSome activists offer up gender equality or gender equity as the endgame, but the meaning of these phrases is hotly contested and lacks any objective criteria by which we may know how and when we may reach this nirvana.\n\nCynics suspect the lack of defin­ition is deliberate. It justifies endless continuation of positive discrimination long beyond the point of legal or moral accept­ability.

I recently began think except for the name of these companies what benefits do they have on your career as an engineer in mining enough to take a lower pay. Sure the benefits are good but those small companies pay OT for their engineers maybe not teck. \n\n*I know this is heavily mine dependent since the culture of the mine influences operation more than the owner.\n\n*I also heard bad things about conuma’s toxic culture I get it but the pay especially with OT is amazing for engineers\n\nIs it just me or does it seem like working for these majors are way overrated? \n",

I have a VISA working holiday.\n\nI have experience (3 years) as a shift supervisor/shift boss (cooking coal mines) working in the development areas of driving faces using blasting materials with steel sets, rebuilding old excavations, gluing the rockmass, mounting steel, and cable bolts, chain and belt conveyors, drainage in very difficult conditions of rockbursts, tremors, and methane in coking coal seams. I worked at levels mainly 1000 meters below the ground. Max 3 faces at a time and a crew of 20 - 40 people in total.\n\nI have a master's degree in mining, but I don't think that makes a difference in this case.\n\nOn the advice of a friend, I sent literally everywhere, even for mining engineer offers from opencast/underground mining. I have never used any software like Desvik at work. I have no planning experience. For supervising I do not have any tickets and it is impossible to make any without a mentor and/or materials from Australia.\n\nDo I have any chance of finding a job in the mining industry here?\n\nProbably someone of you has been in a similar situation or currently working in HR and knows what it looks like from the inside of the recruitment process.\n\nI  sent most resumes to BHP and Rio Tinto. I only got one SHL Talent Assessment from RT a month ago and that's it. All the positions I've applied for (9 at the moment in the \"processing\") are updated periodically, whatever that means. From BHP I got a few video assessments and now in processing is only one.\n\nI honestly admit that I lost hope a bit and I don't know if I should just find an office job for 6 months and then return to my country. Maybe my competencies are just too weak, I overestimated my abilities, and to get a job here you need to be an expert and have 10 years of experience in the industry.",

Anyways, today they sent me the online assessment any I have a few questions:\n- First, does it mean that they took a look at my CV and still gave me a chance or is it automatic ( like anyone who applied has to take the test)?\n- Second, do you have an idea about the test? Is it a personality test or cognitive or both?\n- Last, do you have an idea about the interviews : How many? Are they so technical? \n\nThanks !",

      "post_selftext": "Hi, I am a geologist with 5 years of experience. I went to a couple different schools for undergrad. Santa Barbara City College has an amazing program for those looking for a cheap program with a ton of field trips and a field course before you transfer to a 4-year school. I transferred to Northern Arizona University, and graduated from there with just your basic geology degree. While in school I did a thesis on carbonate sediments in the Nankai trough subduction zone, but other than that I did nothing really outstanding in school. \n\nRegardless, I got a short-term position with Geotemps at the grand canyon right after school. I was hired to classify something like 2000 mineral samples that the park had confiscated from a guy who had been stealing from one of the old copper mines in the park. I spent aboout 9 months living at the Grand Canyon going through these incredibly rare minerals/possibly \"new\" minerals and trying to figure out what they were/classify them/ organize them for the archives. I also supplemented my income by doing lectures on the formation of the Grand Canyon to tour buses. It was an awesome summer.\n\nThen, while working there, I got hired for my current project. It is copper-moly mine that is proposed to open sometime in the next 10-15 years. It will be an underground block-cave mine, and I am part of the shaping team. This prospect is owned by Rio Tinto. I won't mention the name of the mine, and there are some things I won't be able to answer because I'm not sanctioned by work to write about this- but you can figure out which prospect it is pretty easily from the details I have given. There is a website if you want to find out more about the project. Personally, I do a lot of logging core, sampling management, presentations of findings, etc. Standard stuff.\n\nFinally, lately I have been exploring opportunities for side businesses/ outside advancement opportunities in geology. To that end, I made a website to try to provide geologists with information. The site is professionalgeo.com, feel free to check it out although it's still a work in progress. I just felt frustrated with the attitude of \"oh well to get promoted you just wait 20 years\". Also, I've never taken the ASBOG, so that is going to be my study site too.\n\nSorry this got so long...I'll be answering questions all week...Ask me anything!",
