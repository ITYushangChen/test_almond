Couldn't find him anywhere so he went to his Donga to see if he was there.\n Yep he was there, and so was the Crane Driver. They were playing hide the sausage. Upon seeing what they were up to Tony exclaimed \"Ugh What the Fuck\" then promptly left the site.\n This happened a decade ago, but whenever we see a crane we always have a laugh and say \" bloody crane drovers WTF\"😂",

Or at least to how it is in Canada. \n\nAs a male, I've applied hundreds of times for company jobs after extensive contracting work in that specific mining industry, on half a dozen different mine sites operated by that company, and contract work in other mining industries.  \n\nA former female coworker who just got her trade certification applied her first time, interview, job offer. Zero mining experience. And, at THE top choice mine for the fact you can see it from the city. Mine money, home every night. \n\nGranted, she is a very talented sparky and fully deserves that job, and will excel at it. \nShe was a 4th year apprentice when I worked with her on a small shutdown job with a mostly journeyman crew. We all told her she needs to pursue mining as soon as she gets her ticket.\n\nWhile my resume and work experience checks all of the boxes and then some for the actual job, there's a couple big boxes I can not check as male outside of the visible minority group. \n\nHeck, a former male coworker of mine applied for a company job in a different mining industry. We worked together over a number of years on multiple mine sites for this other company, and were working together again when he interviewed for a position. It was during covid, so video interview. \nHe recorded the interview and showed me, asking how I think he did. \n\nThe interview started with \"tell us a bit about yourself\" and he replies with \"uhhhh, my name is Bobby and I uhhh, like electrical\". The rest of the interview was of equal caliber. \nHe got the job. A $60+/hr +OT job at that. \nAgain, he is a very talented electrician, just horrible at interviewing haha. \nHe was able to check the other most important box.",

      "body": "You can believe whatever you want. There is no way I can convince you otherwise.\n\nBut it did happen. It wasn't the first time he got away with it, either.\n\nThey do not use rape kits as often as you seem to want to believe. And, more importantly, rape kits are only able to be used if the victim decides to immediately press charges/immediately seeks medical help. As the police *did not want to investigate, and she was trying to process what had happened and was afraid for her job, do you think a rape kit magically appeared?*\n\nBecause it didn't. And she wasn't his first victim. He had a mistress who was a supervisor who helped these \"problems\" go away. He'd just never been this brazen before. She was extremely well-liked, new, and young. There were certainly never witnesses before, and not a group of them.\n\nHe was also handsome and young with a young family, so people had let a lot of the \"rumours\" slide, cause, like you, they just couldn't believe it had happened. (If you're a miner, I'm sure you understand what extremely small rural communities are like.)\n\nAnd even when there's a rape confession, like in the case of Lyndon Montgomery, who texted his rape victim that he was \"so sorry\" he'd raped her, and even when Holly had *video and photographic evidence of her rape*, a jury still fucking acquitted him, merely because she'd been drinking that day, so maybe she wanted him to break into her house and violently rape her so badly she bled over the sheets.\n\nYou not believing me doesn't make it not true.\n\nThere's plenty of people like you, who don't believe women. Who don't believe these situations happen. Who think there's some kind of justice.\n\nYou don't want to hear the truth. You don't want to hear that even if the woman in question does everything right, it doesn't guarantee the rapist will even go to jail.\n\nYou certainly don't want to hear that in that group, some of the men who witnessed the rape *wanted her to sweep what happened under the rug, and there were only a few men who actually spoke up for her.*\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for the awards.",

About three men in the group were in favour of doing something; the rest either wanted to sweep it under the rug or \"weren't sure\" because the guy was explaining he \"thought she wanted it\" and she was crying (they'd been alerted to her screams) and wondering if she'd \"done something\" to make him think she wanted it. \n\nYou know what she did? On her way to the bathroom (which was outside, away from the party) she dropped something - I think it was her phone - and bent over to pick it up. That's what she did. In that moment (he'd been following her) he pulled down her jeans, and well, I don't need to say the rest. \n\nI made so many phone calls. To the mining company. To the police. \n\nNo one cared. No one returned my calls. No one even acknowledged them. After that (not a miner, only my husband is), the only updates I ever had were from my husband. \n\nI wanted to contact his wife, and almost did, but a friend convinced me not to. She was worried that, especially with young children and his propensity for violence against women, that she'd be in a dangerous situation if she confronted him. \n\nThe only thing the mining company did was move him away to a different site, for his safety. He was fired earlier this year, but only for being shit at his job, nothing else.",

I didn't frame it as gender either, you're perceiving shit.\n\nI have a comparison to another company, to show how stupid your idea of giving a minority, the majority of shares. I picked defence because they had equivalent ratios to make it simple for you. I did take the female specific stats, in order to align the numbers with the mining industry for a balanced comparison 🙂\n\nYou quote me, but it's your statement, so you're having a go at me, for your stupid post lol. Which, okay glad we agree it was dumb, but kinda ironic it's your own words you have issues with.\n\n\"It's like you hooked into my use of the word \"women\" when refering[sic] to the victims, and took this to be some sort of comment motivated by gender, which is probably a projection thing or something.\" - Perfect, we've gotten to your issue. You've literally perfectly explained your problem. I stated gender once halfway through on an article about assault of women in a workplace, and you've tried to imply its motivated by gender and projectionist? Literally what you're doing with this paragraph of stupid examples is focusing/harassing someone because they correctly referenced the gender in an article and called you out for a stupid fucking idea - giving billions of dollars and collapsing an entire business/industry because a percentage of people were harmed there. Forcing tens-hundreds of thousands of people to lose their jobs, while a small minority become wealthy beyond their dreams. That's clearly setting the right message.",

I vaguely recall the occasional bloke starting up on a new girl but a couple of comments and they pull into line quick when they realise they have no support. \n\n\n One of the best franna operators I worked with was a tiny chick and everyone gave her a lot of respect.\n\n\nAnyone in the industry knows you have good camps bad camps and shit camps. I'm curious how many complaints come from the good ones as opposed to the recognised shit ones because the good camps normally attract better quality people. When you start working at the bad or shit camps that's where everyone that can't get into or stay at a good camp goes so it can go downhill quick, gathering the dregs who back each other up like chimps. \n\n\n\nOne thing I find interesting is these articles never talk about the male on male abuse, bullying and assault, far worse than was directed at the girls, and that's something I did see alot of. \n\n\nWhen men commit what, 95% of violent crimes and make up 95% of a workforce in a remote location there's a lot of violence and bullying that doesn't go reported. I won't turn it into a conversation about men but it's worth remembering. ",

I was harassed constantly, had my arse pinched daily and had plenty of sexual innuendo thrown my way.

If one of the boys was cagey about showering with everyone else, you’d find the bloke with the biggest dick and send him in to shower next to him. If you were feeling cheeky, you might piss on your mate’s leg while he was showering next to you. Delightful stuff.   \n\nI’m scratching my head trying to think of a situation where you could “accidentally” piss on a member of the opposite sex, but basically anywhere underground or out bush is fair game for having a piss so I wouldn’t be surprised to hear it happened.",

Seven per cent of respondents reported experiencing sexual harassment, which was on par with 2021.\n\n>BHP states on its website it received 417 reports of sexual harassment in the 2023-2024 financial year. \n\n>It found, of 100 established cases that were investigated across its global operations, one involved sexual assault, 22 involved sexualised and indecent touching and 32 involved sexually aggressive comments, stalking, grooming or image-based harassment. \n\n>BHP states 45 cases involved other forms of sexual harassment, including sexualised conversations or jokes, and 103 individuals responsible had their employment terminated or resigned, while contractors were removed from the site.  \n\nbut i'm sure your reflexive dismissal of the issue of sexual assault in this industry was a totally innocent concern for the facts when put in perspective, and you were just too sleepy to actually inform yourself on the matter or something, right? i mean only a total wanker would do it for the reasons everybody thinks you're doing it.",

      "body": "Besides copying the article verbatim, what are you trying to say? Sexual harassment isn't sexual assault. \n\nAre you reading something I'm not? Maybe im just too much of a sleepy wanker because all I'm seeing is 8 \"people\" in the past year and 5 in 2021.\n\nI mean I'd link sexual harassment statistics for the entire of WA if sexual harassment was a police reportable offence as well but I'd wager that the frequency of sexual harassment is probably miles higher in the general population than in mining, which is all I'm trying to say. That these bullshit news articles are sensationalism and people are too keen to jump on the hatred for mining and fifo bandwagon.\n\nLook at BHPs figures,  you have 417 sexual harassment cases, 100 that are actually established and 1 sexual assault across their *global* operations. That is stunningly low for what is supposed to be some sort of male dominated rape train industry. You can even go ahead and say 3 quarters of everyone it happens to don't report it. That would still be lower than most workplaces. Of course you'll walk away and say it's all covered up but couldn't the same be said for literally any other workplace?\n\nThanks for the emotional escalation and name calling though, \"hawktuah_expert\".",

Is it based on gender representation in the job, and if yes at what arbitrary point in time are we shutting the gate and saying that THIS is the moment we make this definition? Or is.it something else less physically tangible (man break rock good woman cook good)?\n\nYou've already conceded that effectively this is a workplace culture issue (lack of leadership). It's not really apparent to me why the solution is then 'fuck it, segregated workplaces' instead of anything else that might fix these issues.",

Or should we just “believe all women”?\nI find it astounding that so many people here find it hard to believe that most women don’t want to work in shitholes where men have worked for centuries.\nSure there are some, but the job adverts glorify these jobs and make it look like it’s all shits and giggles.

But most don't. \n\n\nThen management asks how she's going and they hear she doesn't feel like part of the team because she has no interest in the things we talk about. \n\n\n\nThat kind of thing has become more common over the years and has evolved to the point where alot of guys don't talk about that stuff anymore hecause they don't want to get singled out in a complaint. \n\n\nThis is a real thing. Worksites with women are noticeably quieter than one where it's all blokes, because alot of blokes have been through one of those meetings. \n\n\nYes celebrities, that's why inspecified celebrities, not women in general. ",

The only people who don’t know what traditional rolls are, are those who have been TAUGHT that we don’t know what traditional men’s roles are. \nThere are not enough people out there to lead. Generally it’s not something you are taught, but if you are going to be taught true leadership, then that takes many, many years. On the same note, working in a strict hierarchy is not most people’s cup of tea either, and these are the only places I have seen it work to any degree.\nJust look at the countries that made it law that there must be 50/50 m/f in the workplace. Doesn’t work at all, men have become more masculine and females more feminine and their reports of sexual assaults in their workplace are no better than anywhere else in the world.\nApologies for the nutbag comment…",

Our interactions with raw human nature end when we finish our morning piss after getting out of bed. Everything else is human nature filtered through a modern capitalist society. The need for shelter is human nature. Signing a mortgage or lease is that human nature filtered through society. The need to eat is human nature. Paying for food is that human nature filtered through a capitalist society, which is why society either punishes (or hopefully tries to help) people who can't. \n\nPeople who can't help but act like morons at work need to either be removed or assisted to change because they're not bothered filtering whatever it is their human nature is telling them to do through the fact that we (as the Joker says) live in a society.

What you said has nothing to do with gender, why is a man or woman more likely to automatically want to talk about cars?\n\n> Darren’s Torana, then becomes bloke talk.\n\nNo, there’s no such thing as ‘bloke talk’. Unless you assume every woman is like Katie, or that every man wants to talk about your mate’s Torana.\n\n> Do you understand? \n\nIncreasingly that you’re a sexist, definitely.\n\n> Ofc there is, same as there is girl talk.

What if he wants to talk about performance issues. You demand he feel comfortable talking in front of a woman?

As for the performance issue topic, well to be honest why would someone be talking about that amongst people they don’t know very well anyway? You’re not providing any context here. Are you guys already good mates? If there was a woman in the group and she was your close mate, I don’t see the issue. Conversely, if a new guy joined the team, why would your mate want to talk about performance issues? Why would he feel comfortable talking about performance issues in front of a new guy?\n\n> No, you’re actually so far off the mark I’ve sent out a search party. You’re determination for bloke talk to be sexist is embarrassing tbh. \n\nOoh seems like I hit a nerve.

One of the lines inclusivity splits along is male/female. \n\nNo, because as per your example, cars are not a male topic. Never have been. And I didn’t say some topics are determinately more inclusive than others, inclusivity is relative to the situation. In your example, it would be more inclusive to find a topic that is more inclusive to all members, male or female.\n\n> ....you’re joking right?\n\nNot at all, but thanks for confirming how limited your thinking is\n\n> If 6 women working with a bloke talk about nail polish is he likely to feel included. No. So the women shelve that topic to help include him and keep that discussion for amongst themselves. By definition, that’s become girl talk. \n\nAgain, stereotypes and weird assumptions. Why do you assume that a male doesn’t want to talk about nail polish? Why do you assume that by your gender you won’t be interested in certain topics.\n\n> and there is nothing wrong with that\n\nAaaaand that’s why you’re sexist dude, thanks for the confirmation, I hope you can find the right path one day\n\n> Not sure why you’re determined to shoehorn sexism into topics of conversation one gender is more likely to enjoy than the other but you do you. \n\nShoehorn? This entire post is about sexism and you gave a sexist example trying to justify your working activities. It’s pretty relevant. I know you don’t think so because you probably think you’re not sexist, but as we found out, your assumptions about genders and their interests, along with your encouragement of these stereotypes are inherently sexist.\n\n> You seem you hold a very low opinion of men, I’m not sure what you’ve been through but I rkn you’re like this because it makes you feel better being derogatory about men if you think they’re being derogatory about women. \n\nThat’s a wonderful attempt to create a backstory about me but I’m not being derogatory towards either gender. I’ve only outlined that what you did and your approach was sexist. Do with that information what you will.\n\n> As I’ve stated multiple times, no sexist comments are supported in the teams I work. \n\nThat’s what you said but it seems in practice there’s a long way to go.",

Transitioned back to a role in corporate and was disgustingly sexually harassed by two senior executives who tried to use their power to try and pressure me into sex and was then forced from the company when I spoke up about it. So in my experience, it depends on who is doing the harassing as to whether there is any action taken. This company has a way better corporate reputation than Rio or BHP but they are all the same when it comes down to it.",

And I’ve seen blokes who have said some stupid shit that deserved the sack and never work in mining again. \n\nI know the site I am at, we have double locks on doors, 24/7 security, a help number, a code word you can say to any camp employee if you’re in danger and much more. Same with on site we have education and a lot of support and all is taken very seriously. Sometimes too far. \n\nUnfortunately, mining camps/sites are big communities. You are always going to get shit people just like you would get in your local suburb regardless how many rules are in place. \n\nMost blokes are good out there on site for these big companies but you are always going to get dickheads. Just like the women who are there. Most are great but some are dicks. Some cause trouble, some put themselves in these shit situations (a girl who is mid 20s recently invited a few old guys in their 50s to the pool area for a swim while she wore a tiny G string bikini) and yes, she should be able to wear that without any issues but cmon now, surely common sense would kick in. \n\nMy point is yes females should feel safe in mining. 100%. But you are going to get a few dickheads and they need to be held accountable and punished accordingly. Also, you need to be careful how you conduct yourself. Both males and females.",

Multiple people witnessed this when they all walked into play pool and stopped what was already too late and happening, The perpetrator was one of the project managers on the contract, next morning police investigation the lot. The company sent him on R&R, she disappeared for 3 months. Once it all died down they both returned to work on opposing rosters (they were 2/2).\nShe said she was hounded non stop by the company to change her story and even blamed her for what happened, she only stayed with the job because the money was ridiculous and they said she would never have to see him again.\n\nHe kept his mouth shut and the vibe towards this guy was different always, he was charged but we never found out what happened officially with sentencing, we assumed he probably got non-custodial sentence for being \"morally upstanding citizen\".\n\nThe fact he was kept onsite later was a fucking joke.",

      "body": "As a man who works in mining, with a wife that also works in mining. I've definitely seen some awful harrassment in the old days. Pre-2010s it was disgusting with heaps of purple circle cover ups, we all felt powerless to do anything about it.\n\nI would say the last 3-5 years there has been a massive cultural shift in the industry. Just the last year on the site we work at three superintendents were terminated, for harassment. Guys that were considered untouchable because of how long they had been here. \n\nAnother example, my wife works in the office and deals with contractors on a daily basis, a new contractor made a sexual joke towards her after she had told him explicitly that she didn't want to hear it, he was on the plane the next day and now has a black mark on his name, and won't be allowed back with the company again.\n\nI have a female coworker last year who was being stalked by a fellow coworker. She was new and had only been here a year, he had been here for 15 years. She reported it, with evidence of text messages and pictures of the stuff he was up to. The guy stood down while under investigation, the stalking continued and then he was terminated.\n\nAs a husband and a father I'm absolutely against this sort of behaviour, and yes mining companies should be held to account as they have a duty of care for their employees. \nBut I just want to call out that there has been a positive change in the industry and have seen more women speak up in the last 2 years than i have seen in the previous 15.",

There are plenty of situations of gender dominated industry workplaces where there is not rampant sexual assault and violence.. Take the IT industry.. I am one of 3 females in an office of 40 and that the men do not feel the need to act in the way.. Or Childcare which is heavily dominated by females.\n\nUnhealthy behaviour is on the part of the individual - that is their responsibility to moderate their behaviour. Its part of a being a responsible, respectful human being. \"Work made me sexually assault and harass women\" is not any kind of explanation..",

There's different people sharing different parts of your life.\n\n\nTry this: think about how very different it would be if you and all those guys were locked in your office building for 2 weeks and only able to go home for a week (5 days really because the commute each way takes up a full day) before being locked into the office building for another 2 weeks. Except when it rains and the exits get blocked so you can't leave at all, so might be stuck out there for more than a month. You don't get see your loved ones or your family, you spend all of your time with the people you work with. And the only recreation you get is whatever your company has decided to put in the building. Oh yeah, it's company WiFi and and mobile reception is spotty as well.\n\n\nThat's camp life.\n\n\nThe CAMPS are ISOLATED and have minimal facilities of any kind. \nHere's a list of the facilities available at two Pilbara camps:\nhttps://pilbaraminerals.com.au/work-with-us/life-on-site/\n\n\nIn your free time, you can enjoy tennis, basketball, a driving range or mountainous biking.

I have worked for BHP, Rio, Citic Pacific, and a bunch of gold companies. \n\nI have seen the good, the bad, and the ugly, with regard to anyone not a white male worker. \n\nBut this situation took the cake. And outlined, to me, how utterly clueless big mining is.\n\nOn commencement of employment with BHP at the new shiny South Flank in mid 2021. I witnessed a situation that still blows my mind to this day. \n\nThe Mulla Mulla camp is truly a modern, well appointed, camp. With a cafe, bar, multiple gyms, meditation, music and rec rooms. \n\nAnd BHP had a full on no harassment policy in place with training. For employees. Etc. \n\nAnd yet they had a couple of thousand BHP employees. Many of whom where young woman new to mining. In a camp alongside 100’s if not a thousand non BHP construction contractors. Full of young men having an awesome time with no alcohol limits (at that time). All mixing at the main bar. Which most people had to walk through to get to their accommodation. \n\nI spotted the potential problem immediately. And it was only weeks before the first media stories surfaced of rape and attempted rape in that camp. \n\nBut not a single BHP manager seemed to have an issue with this. Which I brought up in pre-start meetings, and often commented on. No one was interested.\n\nAnd it wasn’t until construction was finished and all the dickhead construction contractors left that things quieted down. But by that time the damage was done. \n\nThis just highlighted the problem mining has with ANY equality. Gender bias is not exclusive. I have seen, and continue to see, ANYONE who is not one of the group. Get picked on mercilessly. Every day. And every night. \nIt really is just a symptom of the issues in our Australian community. But magnified by the mining lifestyle.\n\nMining management doesn’t really care. As all they ever do is try and keep everything quiet. And it hasn’t changed much in 24 years.\n\nTLDR: Mining management are truly clueless. And don’t really care.",

Reporting it the next day got laughs and jokes about how I can easily date a driller. Only the drill foreman took it seriously and then he started sexually harassing me that night when I was alone in my work tent. Again, reporting it got jokes about dating the foreman instead. Genuinely scary enough that we had locals coming to site with guns and committing arson because they didn't want a mine there and then I had to deal with these creeps too! \n\n\nI guess we were expected to tolerate it and nothing was ever done about it anywhere I worked, except a single mine in Manitoba where the Director of Exploration had a zero tolerance policy and a team full of women (because he made it a safe space so we all stayed).",

      "body": "I won't hold back here.\n\nI just resigned from mining ( BHP Olympic Dam ) and worked for both BHP and Rio Tinto throughout my career. I only finished my final swing last week and flew home. In 2021, 22, 23 there were gang rapes of women on camp and I assure you this demeaning view of women FIFOs only there as sexual receptacles and entertainment is still thriving and very alive and well. This abhorrent culture is championed by supervisors and managers, usually as subcontractors for the mines. I heard a joke told at toolbox the other day. It was made by the Superintendent ( the highest rank ). He said ( What does a woman and carpet have in common? if you lay them right the first time you can walk all over them later ), no one laughed and I called it out. I told him that's not OK and he told me to get over it. BHP know this happens and they don't care. I later had a go at the Super again one on one, but he argued with me that I couldn't take a joke. When BHP or Tinto tender for contractors, they just choose the cheapest and the fastest, regardless of your crew being made up of rapists and misogynists. This will continue forever, because talent is chosen over integrity. I find women crying every day. One young lady is leaving because her boss encourages his team to tease her at Olympic Dam BHP site. The boss says to her \" Are you finished yet, or are you one of those women who takes ages to orgasm\" ? then the rest of his crew follow up and do the same all day. She now messed up so bad. I have also overheard the pack and there's lots of them comment when a new girl starts. I've overheard \" I wonder if she'll buck like a bull or if you have to poke her with a cattle prod, \" and \" she looks like hard work, frigid\" and \" I wonder if that ones into choking while poking\", then everyone laughs, then another pack passing the hardhat around on a new girl, putting 20 dollars notes in and the first two guys to R\\* her get all the coin . I've just put here the mild stuff. I always called it out, but it just keeps going. If anyone in my crew had this mentality it's instant dismissal and I never lost one, because I didn't employ rapists. All these issues come from the top down, from managers down to workers. I'm out now and can't help any more women, but proud of myself for standing up against feral, brothers who have destroyed womens' lives with \" just a joke\" \" just a touch \" \" just a dick pic \" . Please speak out for women, they need us to protect them from the evil ones",

They will be talking about you in the most disgusting way behind your back, so don't trust any of them. They will be your best mate to your face, then in a pack talking about you. Get on your flight, don't talk, get off you flight, straight to camp, get dinner early, don't sit with anyone, because the moment you do, the gossip starts, talk to your family at night, read and digital detox. Find a female FIFO buddy and stick together. Don't wear skimpy clothes to the gym and plan your laundry times. You've got this young lady, you'll be fine. Just remember it's a job, but unlike other jobs , it's set up as social housing. You can either socailize or work, you can't do both, you choose. You've got this. If you need more advice contact me and I'll help. Also, if you are a direct employee of BHP, you will not be hassled as BHP employees are off limits, so you won't be bothered. Harassing a BHP employee gets you a window ticket home and a 2 years ban.\n\nFly In\n\nWork\n\nPlan\n\nBe insular\n\nFly out rinse, repeat, save money and do 10 years, then get out",

      "body": "I have seen some crazy shit myself, having worked as a contractor in the mines. I was on site and a worker got pulled into a closed room with two other people. Immediately I hear scuttling of chairs and a loud bang and a whiteboard fell off the wall on the other side of the room. About 15 minutes later this guy leaves the room and it's pretty clear he'd been roughed up (red puffy face, drooping eye, shaking uncontrollably). The two blokes that belted him were \"high ups\" and in fact one ended up being promoted to the most senior role on the mine shortly (<1 year after). How can women be expected to deal with these kind of people? I have seen altercations on site before (I work predominantly in construction) but this was very different because this guy walked into the room without any idea of what was going to happen to him. This bloke was older, easy going and not violent in any way at all, and would never have provoked anyone.\n\nThe industry is full of bikies and organised crime. They pile up their Harley's 40 deep at the mining camps. The number of boats, high end cars and abandoned vehicles at the camps gives you a hint of what the industry is like. You'd think they'd keep their toys at home (or that there'd be some kind of company policy banning personal vehicles from the camps) but you quickly realise that it's about establishing a \"presence\". There is open prostitution run at some of the pubs in the mining towns where they bus in girls for \"tours\" (no, it's not just stripping like they want you to think). You have to share a non detached donga where you can here the guy next to you slapping his mustard at night. Without fail the phone reception drops out 5:00PM every afternoon because there's too many people watching porn and the mining company doesn't want to pay Telstra to put in a new tower. There are cameras absolutely everywhere in the camps because the trust level is zero.\n\nThe real trouble is we've made our society such that the mining industry is the only way to earn a liveable wage. We need to support these women to get the fuck out of these industries because these people are grubs.",

      "body": "If money/remuneration is the sole goal of a job, yes smaller companies tend to use higher salaries to attract and retain talent. Sometimes you can get real lucky and find a place with high salary and good culture. \n\nLarger companies tend not to pay as well, however they are generally more concerned with your cultural fit as an individual. They know they can attract talent without paying a premium, so they will be careful about their choice. \n\nLarger companies also have good company benefits since they can leverage economies of scale (share purchase program, medical, 401k, annual leave days, child benefits)\n\nImo rio tinto also pays less than bhp /glencore. However Rio culture tends to be a bit better than  BHP, especially around safety. Glencore pays the best, but it is very much sink or swim; perform or you will be terminated. \n\nLarger companies also have career progression opportunities within the company. Not unusual to have people stay for decades; probably not the most optimal for salary growth but it's stable. \n\nRemember that careers are a marathon, not a sprint. Find something that works for you and can be sustained long term. Can you survive constantly doing OT to push your salary higher? Probably not for the long term.",

      "body": "I work in the power utility industry doing HV work mainly powerline work. We got an external hire female manager with no industry experience or electrical background. A customer complained that the overhead transformer we were about to put up a pole would ruin their view. I got pulled into the office on the day of the power outage and asked why I couldn’t put the overhead transformer on the ground, or paint it or put it on a different pole. They even took my joke about throwing camouflage netting over the transformer seriously. One of the men who applied had been at the company for years, had done the job temporarily for years, had an electrical trade and was very well loved by everyone in the section, yet didn’t get the job.\n\nNot to mention it’s pretty well known HR wants majority female apprentices. It’s bringing up so many issues. They get protected so much that we have female apprentices finishing up that can’t do very simple tasks but instead of being performance managed they’re able to just refuse to do it till a male does it. Not to mention almost all female apprentices we’ve had have gone into the office within two years post-apprenticeship due to injury leaving us very short staffed in the field. Our HR team also likes to hire female apprentices who can’t get their truck licence so everytime we work rural someone has to pack up equipment to drive them to the bathroom.",

      "body": "DEI is very popular with old men, and mildly popular with young women. Yes, it's US data, but a US poll found that more young Democratic men thought \"feminism does more harm than good\" than old Republicans. And old Democratic men agreed feminism was a good thing with all the vigour of North Koreans agreeing that their Great Leader was doing a pretty good job. https://www.splcenter.org/news/2022/06/01/poll-finds-support-great-replacement-hard-right-ideas#gender\n\nThere's also emerging evidence that DEI is a \"luxury belief\". Successful firms tend to have it, but they also tend to have things like fish tanks in the lobby, and nice looking buildings.\n\nFinally, there's a very obvious reason why men tend to go into STEM - it's very well established that teachers discriminate against men, and it's harder to discriminate in a math test than a humanities essay. Students often focus on (and pick) subjects they do well at, and heavier discrimination in humanities will lead to boys having a relative advantage in STEM, while girls have a relative advantage in humanities (a lack of privilege feels like discrimination to them). It's also the subjects \"model minorities\" (Asians, Indians - the type of students who teachers might discriminate against) tend to flock to.",

All because she had the correct organs. Instead of a proper hire, it was more like a wrecking ball. The existing staff were not happy and she was being white anted as a result.

There were particular older men who would sit there during the day, at crib, down at the wet mess, and spend half the day having a go at these women. And cruel jokes played by the younger men both at the site proper, and back at their dongas.\n\nWhen the woman had enough and left the table at less, or the space, it would be \"what did I say?\". And when she inevitably quit, it would be \"women can't hack it out here\". And since I would have been sitting there the entire time they were saying some really nasty shit to whichever woman dared to join the crew, directed at me would always be \"not you, of course\". Because I didn't stick my head out, as I was too worried that I would be next on their hit list. Just their not so subtle little reminder that that it would be me if I made waves. \n\nThe key point was that they didn't do that to the blokes.  The worst one of them got was a ribbing when he decided not to drink water so he didn't have to get out of the cab to pee, and got so dehydrated he nearly put the bucket through a truck window. \n\nIf they want to have targets until they can stamp out that kind of bullshit, let them have targets until things even out a bit. But they need to clamp down on the bullying behaviour at the same time, or things will never change.",

Now maybe you might not always get the best applicants because of that (at first), but you should still be getting qualified applicants none the less. Once you get a field used to having more women in it, it moderates to their existence and becomes more tolerable for women but also encourages a pipeline of future woman to see it as a field worth working/studying towards.\n\nThere's a bit of thought behind this, more than it being a morally right thing to do in most cases. But generally it can be a short term hit, for a long term cultural shift that will yield more economic benefits down the line... It turns out having half your population also capable of participating in the economy, whom then pay more taxes, as much as possible is a good thing for the economy and society at large, who knew.\n\nMay be hit and miss depending on the field of course.\n\nHiring a random person for the sake of it would be a bad use of such targets, but I do wonder how often its exactly the case of a random being hired, or a woman who is also qualified being hired, but viewed as just being a random from assumption.  Alas your company should be also training people anyway, provided they are sufficiently qualified for the role. Blame should always lie with poor implementation, not the morally justifiable intention.",

      "body": "While the Americanisms are annoying, you are likely right. Having to hear about gender equality, dei, sexual harassment cases and now things like 4b movements are just getting over the top.\n\nI'm alright with the occasional discussion about things affecting women but it is every discussion and I would argue an overload of it. Not to mention I am pretty sure that hiring opportunities for myself have been limited due to sexism from these ideological stances.\n\n  \nAlso there is an unspoken aspect of feminism that gets glossed over, that it is in a lot of cases about retribution than empowerment or equality at all. Making up for interpreted hardships of the past and getting revenge from those hardships. To me this makes the argument for an ideology being respected, listened to or taken seriously in instances like this article talking about equality to be very hard to do as for a lot of women following the movement its about restricting men like they think they were restricted in the past. It's revenge and being spiteful, not about women's rights in those instances. I would call that organized crime than a positive movement when it is approached like that, and I have heard it approached like that in more instances than I need.",

These minesites are all governed by fund managers (blackrock, Vanguard, safesteet and combinations) which provide low interest loans and investment for complying with their ESG programs. The idea of ESG is to ensure companies don't pollute and treat their workers and community well (and not just focus on profits). ESG has been corrupted and companies have worked out it's way cheaper to hire minorities to boost ESG instead of recycling or investing in renewables. They don't care about minorities, they're avoiding spending money by shuffling their employee makeup to boost their rating and ensure investment. When you turnover as much as these outfits do it's more profitable to lower cost of investment than increasing revenue.\nI am all for women's equality and equal opportunity for minorities but white men are literally being purged as unfavourable for the % shown on reports.\nMost men love their families and friends, women included. Nobody under the age of 55 says women should stay put.\nForget about what grifting websites say (who are held to the same ESG programs). Look outside and judge.",

      "post_selftext": "Can't say I blame the guys when targets inevitably lead to diversity hires and diversity hires get no respect.\n\nI'm all for hiring more women in male dominated work places, but only if the policy is to get more women to apply thus making it far more likely a woman will be the best applicant. \n\nIf the policy is simply hire more women then if ten people were interviewed for a job,  9 men and one woman,  you already know who's getting the job. You also know there's a good chance she wasn't the best applicant and she will be treated as a diversity hire on site. Unfortunately so will most women,  even though many will be employed because they were the best applicant.  The bulk of the men will just assume a woman is there because of her extra x chromosome and nothing more. \n\nTargets lower morale and devalue the people you proport to value.\n\nOn the other hand Rio thinks it will make them look good and we will forget about the massive polution and environmental destruction and the destruction of ancient aboriginal sites.

Aside from rumours and stories, I know a mate's mate can't leave his role because no one wants to hire him as his only experience is with one of these companies.\n\nThank you op for the review, hope you find something better",

I've only done two vacation programs in underground mining, one where it mined 1 million tonnes per annum with a workforce of 500 and the other was 13 million tonnes with a 3500 person workforce. \n\n\nThe difference is night and day between a smaller operation and one of the largest mines in the world. At the smaller operation we always had pre start meetings with all the tech services and shift bosses (night shift and incoming day shift). That was never there at the BHP operation apart from within your own department, so little interactions between the other areas. They were referred to as 'customers', which was painful to hear cause they are just your colleagues in different departments. So no chance of any banter and truly getting to know them. I totally get that it's a way larger site and it has to operate differently. \n\n\nYou're totally spot on about the hardships and having to wear it. As the surveyor on two occasions I didn't get the authority to excavate signed off in time for night shifts and had to wear it. It definitely builds some resilience in you. \n\n\nI definitely noticed that some employees and especially the senior ones have often only ever worked at BHP or Rio since they finished uni. So they don't get any idea how anything else is operated or see the benefits of working elsewhere. ",

      "post_selftext": "\n\nThe whole mood around the pit yesterday was solemn. Nobody talked, openly at least, about the man who killed himself, whom I’ll refer to from this point forward as John. The news of his suicide spread like wildfire among the community hours after it happened, but it didn’t make any news stories. In fact, it didn’t make anything at all. Even his daughter, whom is avid about Facebook and Twitter, was tight-lipped about it online. For all intents and purposes, there was no record of him having died at all as far as we could tell.\n\nWork went about in a normal capacity, and someone had even taken up John’s job seamlessly. It was as if he’d never been there in the first place.\n\nIt was around lunch time that something changed.\n\nTim, the man who’d told me the story from my previous post, sat down across form me in the cafeteria. This, in itself, wasn’t that strange – we’d eaten lunch before, often with John and a handful of other people – but it was the conversation he struck almost immediately after sitting down.\n\nHis voice was hurried, shaken, and he spoke in a low tone that was almost a whisper.\n\n“I’m going down there,” he said.\n\nI didn’t reply. At first, I wasn’t honestly sure what it was he was talking about, but it dawned on me at the exact moment he continued to speak.\n\n“I’m going down to the bottom of the pit. John used to work close to the bottom – he actually KNEW the guy that I told you about yesterday that went crazy – and he almost never talked about it. I got the impression he saw or heard something he shouldn’t and that he was honestly afraid of the things going on down the mine. If he killed himself, which I’m not convinced it was as plain as that, I think he did it because he was scared. He had a lot to live for, but whatever he knew was either too dangerous for him to stay alive, or too terrifying for him to want to continue living.”\n\nI didn’t say anything for a moment after that, but instead let what he said hang in the air between us like the blade of a guillotine. Although I hadn’t said it outright to Tim, I believed we shared the same feeling that whomever was running the mine had more control over our lives than we cared for. If he crossed them, he would be vaporized from existence – and me along with him. Simply being a part of the conversation that was happening was enough, I think, to merit action by the upper echelons. The moment he sat down, hell, maybe even the moment we met in the Filling Station, our lives were already in danger.\n\nI agreed to help him.\n\nThere was no point in waiting to carry out the plan that Tim had devised. Being that we were likely already on the radar, waiting even 24 hours could mean that one or both of us would go missing before carrying out the plan.\n\nTim’s plan was simple, really, and it started with me feigning a stomach ache. I was so nervous it wasn’t hard to force myself to throw up, and after making a mess all over the dirt, I was sent home by my supervisor.\n\nI drove nearly home, just as Tim instructed, then double-backed up the highway and turned my radio to the channel I was told.\n\nHe’d been very specific on where I should wait to hear from him. It was a few miles down a dirt road in Herriman. I knew what he’d been planning to do, but I didn’t believe he’d actually do it until I saw the dust being kicked up on the other side of a hill.\n\nOne of the big Kennecott trucks – the kind that goes down to the bottom of the mine and drives through the tunnels – came up and over the hill with Tim in the driver’s seat. I sat in my truck, watching as he drove the truck past the road where I sat and up a small canyon.\n\nIn the years that he’d worked for the mine, he’d made some friends, as he put it, and those friends had managed to get him the keys to one of the trucks that he’d otherwise need special clearance to drive.\n\nI heard his voice on the radio then, and I nearly jumped out of my skin.\n\n“You there?”\n\nI told him I was.\n\n“Keep the channel open, and don’t use my name. I’m going to report to you what I see as I go down this tunnel. No matter what happens to me, I want you to share with everyone what I tell you. Understand?”\n\nI told him I did.\n\nThe next forty-five minutes was completely silent. I sat and played games on my phone and listened to music, but I couldn’t help the knot forming in my stomach. I thought for a moment that perhaps I didn’t actually fake being sick. I was hot and feverish from the anxiety and my stomach bile felt like it was going to burn a hole right through me.\n\nWhen the voice came over the radio again, I’d almost begun to give up hope that he’d made it.\n\n“I’m in.”\n\nFrom this point forward, as requested by Tim, I will transcribe everything that was said over the radio.\n\nTIM: I’m in the tunnel now. They searched the truck and let me in. I passed two of those guard dogs they talk about on the signs in the lower tunnels. They’re big fuckers – I wouldn’t want to be on the wrong end of them.\n\nI don’t think they’ve been mining these tunnels. There are huge veins of copper and gold that don’t look like they’ll ever be excavated. I think they’re working on getting deeper into the mountains.\n\nSILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES\n\nTIM: I just saw a caution sign, sort of like the one in the pit, but this one is different. It says:\n\nCAUTION\n\nGloves and protective masks must be worn from this point forward. Under no circumstances are you to remove them.\n\nAll fossils and artifacts must be reported immediately upon excavation.\n\nRio Tinto accepts no responsibility for any physical, mental, or emotional damage past this point. \n\nSILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES\n\nTIM: I’m still in the truck and I’ve reached a big room. I’ve got a mask and gloves from the cab of the truck. I’m gonna get out and take a look here.\n\nIt looks sort of like a bomb shelter. There are these barrels that look like whiskey barrels all over the place. I think they’re Cedar maybe.\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever seen a vein of copper this big. It’s like they dug the room out of the stuff. The walls and everything are almost all completely unrefined copper.\n\nI can’t seem to open any of the barrels, but there’s something weird about them. I feel warm, but not on the outside.\n\nSILENCE FOR APPROXIMATELY TEN MINUTES\n\nTIM: Someone’s following me. I can hear them talking to me. They know my name.\n\nSILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES\n\nTIM: I’m trying to come out now, but he won’t stop following me. He wants me to take off my helmet.\n\nSILENCE\n\nI’m going to take off my helmet.\n\nME: Don’t take off your helmet! I’m on my way.\n\nSILENCE\n\n*Inaudible audio*\n\nNote: Tim began to speak in another voice here. I could hear his voice in it, but I do not believe that it was him speaking. I believe it was something or someone else speaking THROUGH him.\n\nVOICE: Come unto me.\n\nME: What was that?\n\nVOICE: Come unto me my child and partake of the manna of heaven. For with it, ye shall know everlasting life.\n\nTIM: *Crying* I will. I will.\n\nME: Get out of there!\n\nVOICE: Timothy. Look upon me and see.\n\nTIM: Screaming.\n\nVOICE: Do you believe in God?\n\nRADIO STATIC.\n\nSILENCE.\n\n \n\nI haven’t seen or heard from Tim since then.\n\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6mmzxz/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecot_copper_mine/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6nayvc/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecot_copper_mine/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6o24nv/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecott_copper_mine/)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6ob1fm/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecott_copper_mine/)\n",

      "post_selftext": "\n\nThe whole mood around the pit yesterday was solemn. Nobody talked, openly at least, about the man who killed himself, whom I’ll refer to from this point forward as John. The news of his suicide spread like wildfire among the community hours after it happened, but it didn’t make any news stories. In fact, it didn’t make anything at all. Even his daughter, whom is avid about Facebook and Twitter, was tight-lipped about it online. For all intents and purposes, there was no record of him having died at all as far as we could tell.\n\nWork went about in a normal capacity, and someone had even taken up John’s job seamlessly. It was as if he’d never been there in the first place.\n\nIt was around lunch time that something changed.\n\nTim, the man who’d told me the story from my previous post, sat down across form me in the cafeteria. This, in itself, wasn’t that strange – we’d eaten lunch before, often with John and a handful of other people – but it was the conversation he struck almost immediately after sitting down.\n\nHis voice was hurried, shaken, and he spoke in a low tone that was almost a whisper.\n\n“I’m going down there,” he said.\n\nI didn’t reply. At first, I wasn’t honestly sure what it was he was talking about, but it dawned on me at the exact moment he continued to speak.\n\n“I’m going down to the bottom of the pit. John used to work close to the bottom – he actually KNEW the guy that I told you about yesterday that went crazy – and he almost never talked about it. I got the impression he saw or heard something he shouldn’t and that he was honestly afraid of the things going on down the mine. If he killed himself, which I’m not convinced it was as plain as that, I think he did it because he was scared. He had a lot to live for, but whatever he knew was either too dangerous for him to stay alive, or too terrifying for him to want to continue living.”\n\nI didn’t say anything for a moment after that, but instead let what he said hang in the air between us like the blade of a guillotine. Although I hadn’t said it outright to Tim, I believed we shared the same feeling that whomever was running the mine had more control over our lives than we cared for. If he crossed them, he would be vaporized from existence – and me along with him. Simply being a part of the conversation that was happening was enough, I think, to merit action by the upper echelons. The moment he sat down, hell, maybe even the moment we met in the Filling Station, our lives were already in danger.\n\nI agreed to help him.\n\nThere was no point in waiting to carry out the plan that Tim had devised. Being that we were likely already on the radar, waiting even 24 hours could mean that one or both of us would go missing before carrying out the plan.\n\nTim’s plan was simple, really, and it started with me feigning a stomach ache. I was so nervous it wasn’t hard to force myself to throw up, and after making a mess all over the dirt, I was sent home by my supervisor.\n\nI drove nearly home, just as Tim instructed, then double-backed up the highway and turned my radio to the channel I was told.\n\nHe’d been very specific on where I should wait to hear from him. It was a few miles down a dirt road in Herriman. I knew what he’d been planning to do, but I didn’t believe he’d actually do it until I saw the dust being kicked up on the other side of a hill.\n\nOne of the big Kennecott trucks – the kind that goes down to the bottom of the mine and drives through the tunnels – came up and over the hill with Tim in the driver’s seat. I sat in my truck, watching as he drove the truck past the road where I sat and up a small canyon.\n\nIn the years that he’d worked for the mine, he’d made some friends, as he put it, and those friends had managed to get him the keys to one of the trucks that he’d otherwise need special clearance to drive.\n\nI heard his voice on the radio then, and I nearly jumped out of my skin.\n\n“You there?”\n\nI told him I was.\n\n“Keep the channel open, and don’t use my name. I’m going to report to you what I see as I go down this tunnel. No matter what happens to me, I want you to share with everyone what I tell you. Understand?”\n\nI told him I did.\n\nThe next forty-five minutes was completely silent. I sat and played games on my phone and listened to music, but I couldn’t help the knot forming in my stomach. I thought for a moment that perhaps I didn’t actually fake being sick. I was hot and feverish from the anxiety and my stomach bile felt like it was going to burn a hole right through me.\n\nWhen the voice came over the radio again, I’d almost begun to give up hope that he’d made it.\n\n“I’m in.”\n\nFrom this point forward, as requested by Tim, I will transcribe everything that was said over the radio.\n\nTIM: I’m in the tunnel now. They searched the truck and let me in. I passed two of those guard dogs they talk about on the signs in the lower tunnels. They’re big fuckers – I wouldn’t want to be on the wrong end of them.\n\nI don’t think they’ve been mining these tunnels. There are huge veins of copper and gold that don’t look like they’ll ever be excavated. I think they’re working on getting deeper into the mountains.\n\nSILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES\n\nTIM: I just saw a caution sign, sort of like the one in the pit, but this one is different. It says:\n\nCAUTION\n\nGloves and protective masks must be worn from this point forward. Under no circumstances are you to remove them.\n\nAll fossils and artifacts must be reported immediately upon excavation.\n\nRio Tinto accepts no responsibility for any physical, mental, or emotional damage past this point. \n\nSILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES\n\nTIM: I’m still in the truck and I’ve reached a big room. I’ve got a mask and gloves from the cab of the truck. I’m gonna get out and take a look here.\n\nIt looks sort of like a bomb shelter. There are these barrels that look like whiskey barrels all over the place. I think they’re Cedar maybe.\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever seen a vein of copper this big. It’s like they dug the room out of the stuff. The walls and everything are almost all completely unrefined copper.\n\nI can’t seem to open any of the barrels, but there’s something weird about them. I feel warm, but not on the outside.\n\nSILENCE FOR APPROXIMATELY TEN MINUTES\n\nTIM: Someone’s following me. I can hear them talking to me. They know my name.\n\nSILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES\n\nTIM: I’m trying to come out now, but he won’t stop following me. He wants me to take off my helmet.\n\nSILENCE\n\nI’m going to take off my helmet.\n\nME: Don’t take off your helmet! I’m on my way.\n\nSILENCE\n\n*Inaudible audio*\n\nNote: Tim began to speak in another voice here. I could hear his voice in it, but I do not believe that it was him speaking. I believe it was something or someone else speaking THROUGH him.\n\nVOICE: Come unto me.\n\nME: What was that?\n\nVOICE: Come unto me my child and partake of the manna of heaven.

      "post_selftext": "The whole mood around the pit yesterday was solemn. Nobody talked, openly at least, about the man who killed himself, whom I’ll refer to from this point forward as John. The news of his suicide spread like wildfire among the community hours after it happened, but it didn’t make any news stories. In fact, it didn’t make anything at all. Even his daughter, whom is avid about Facebook and Twitter, was tight-lipped about it online. For all intents and purposes, there was no record of him having died at all as far as we could tell.\n\nWork went about in a normal capacity, and someone had even taken up John’s job seamlessly. It was as if he’d never been there in the first place.\n\nIt was around lunch time that something changed.\n\nTim, the man who’d told me the story from my previous post, sat down across form me in the cafeteria. This, in itself, wasn’t that strange – we’d eaten lunch before, often with John and a handful of other people – but it was the conversation he struck almost immediately after sitting down.\n\nHis voice was hurried, shaken, and he spoke in a low tone that was almost a whisper.\n\n“I’m going down there,” he said.\n\nI didn’t reply. At first, I wasn’t honestly sure what it was he was talking about, but it dawned on me at the exact moment he continued to speak.\n\n“I’m going down to the bottom of the pit. John used to work close to the bottom – he actually KNEW the guy that I told you about yesterday that went crazy – and he almost never talked about it. I got the impression he saw or heard something he shouldn’t and that he was honestly afraid of the things going on down the mine. If he killed himself, which I’m not convinced it was as plain as that, I think he did it because he was scared. He had a lot to live for, but whatever he knew was either too dangerous for him to stay alive, or too terrifying for him to want to continue living.”\n\nI didn’t say anything for a moment after that, but instead let what he said hang in the air between us like the blade of a guillotine. Although I hadn’t said it outright to Tim, I believed we shared the same feeling that whomever was running the mine had more control over our lives than we cared for. If he crossed them, he would be vaporized from existence – and me along with him. Simply being a part of the conversation that was happening was enough, I think, to merit action by the upper echelons. The moment he sat down, hell, maybe even the moment we met in the Filling Station, our lives were already in danger.\n\nI agreed to help him.\n\nThere was no point in waiting to carry out the plan that Tim had devised. Being that we were likely already on the radar, waiting even 24 hours could mean that one or both of us would go missing before carrying out the plan.\n\nTim’s plan was simple, really, and it started with me feigning a stomach ache. I was so nervous it wasn’t hard to force myself to throw up, and after making a mess all over the dirt, I was sent home by my supervisor.\n\nI drove nearly home, just as Tim instructed, then double-backed up the highway and turned my radio to the channel I was told.\n\nHe’d been very specific on where I should wait to hear from him. It was a few miles down a dirt road in Herriman. I knew what he’d been planning to do, but I didn’t believe he’d actually do it until I saw the dust being kicked up on the other side of a hill.\n\nOne of the big Kennecott trucks – the kind that goes down to the bottom of the mine and drives through the tunnels – came up and over the hill with Tim in the driver’s seat. I sat in my truck, watching as he drove the truck past the road where I sat and up a small canyon.\n\nIn the years that he’d worked for the mine, he’d made some friends, as he put it, and those friends had managed to get him the keys to one of the trucks that he’d otherwise need special clearance to drive.\n\nI heard his voice on the radio then, and I nearly jumped out of my skin.\n\n“You there?”\n\nI told him I was.\n\n“Keep the channel open, and don’t use my name. I’m going to report to you what I see as I go down this tunnel. No matter what happens to me, I want you to share with everyone what I tell you. Understand?”\n\nI told him I did.\n\nThe next forty-five minutes was completely silent. I sat and played games on my phone and listened to music, but I couldn’t help the knot forming in my stomach. I thought for a moment that perhaps I didn’t actually fake being sick. I was hot and feverish from the anxiety and my stomach bile felt like it was going to burn a hole right through me.\n\nWhen the voice came over the radio again, I’d almost begun to give up hope that he’d made it.\n\n“I’m in.”\n\nFrom this point forward, as requested by Tim, I will transcribe everything that was said over the radio.\n\nTIM: I’m in the tunnel now. They searched the truck and let me in. I passed two of those guard dogs they talk about on the signs in the lower tunnels. They’re big fuckers – I wouldn’t want to be on the wrong end of them.\n\nI don’t think they’ve been mining these tunnels. There are huge veins of copper and gold that don’t look like they’ll ever be excavated. I think they’re working on getting deeper into the mountains.\n\nSILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES\n\nTIM: I just saw a caution sign, sort of like the one in the pit, but this one is different. It says:\n\nCAUTION\n\nGloves and protective masks must be worn from this point forward. Under no circumstances are you to remove them.\n\nAll fossils and artifacts must be reported immediately upon excavation.\n\nRio Tinto accepts no responsibility for any physical, mental, or emotional damage past this point. \n\nSILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES\n\nTIM: I’m still in the truck and I’ve reached a big room. I’ve got a mask and gloves from the cab of the truck. I’m gonna get out and take a look here.\n\nIt looks sort of like a bomb shelter. There are these barrels that look like whiskey barrels all over the place. I think they’re Cedar maybe.\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever seen a vein of copper this big. It’s like they dug the room out of the stuff. The walls and everything are almost all completely unrefined copper.\n\nI can’t seem to open any of the barrels, but there’s something weird about them. I feel warm, but not on the outside.\n\nSILENCE FOR APPROXIMATELY TEN MINUTES\n\nTIM: Someone’s following me. I can hear them talking to me. They know my name.\n\nSILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES\n\nTIM: I’m trying to come out now, but he won’t stop following me. He wants me to take off my helmet.\n\nSILENCE\n\nI’m going to take off my helmet.\n\nME: Don’t take off your helmet! I’m on my way.\n\nSILENCE\n\n*Inaudible audio*\n\nNote: Tim began to speak in another voice here. I could hear his voice in it, but I do not believe that it was him speaking. I believe it was something or someone else speaking THROUGH him.\n\nVOICE: Come unto me.\n\nME: What was that?\n\nVOICE: Come unto me my child and partake of the manna of heaven. For with it, ye shall know everlasting life.\n\nTIM: *Crying* I will. I will.\n\nME: Get out of there!\n\nVOICE: Timothy. Look upon me and see.\n\nTIM: Screaming.\n\nVOICE: Do you believe in God?\n\nRADIO STATIC.\n\nSILENCE.\n\n \n\nI haven’t seen or heard from Tim since then.\n\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6mmzxz/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecot_copper_mine/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6nayvc/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecot_copper_mine/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6o24nv/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecott_copper_mine/)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6ob1fm/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecott_copper_mine/)",

      "post_selftext": "The whole mood around the pit yesterday was solemn. Nobody talked, openly at least, about the man who killed himself, whom I’ll refer to from this point forward as John. The news of his suicide spread like wildfire among the community hours after it happened, but it didn’t make any news stories. In fact, it didn’t make anything at all. Even his daughter, whom is avid about Facebook and Twitter, was tight-lipped about it online. For all intents and purposes, there was no record of him having died at all as far as we could tell.\n\nWork went about in a normal capacity, and someone had even taken up John’s job seamlessly. It was as if he’d never been there in the first place.\n\nIt was around lunch time that something changed.\n\nTim, the man who’d told me the story from my previous post, sat down across form me in the cafeteria. This, in itself, wasn’t that strange – we’d eaten lunch before, often with John and a handful of other people – but it was the conversation he struck almost immediately after sitting down.\n\nHis voice was hurried, shaken, and he spoke in a low tone that was almost a whisper.\n\n“I’m going down there,” he said.\n\nI didn’t reply. At first, I wasn’t honestly sure what it was he was talking about, but it dawned on me at the exact moment he continued to speak.\n\n“I’m going down to the bottom of the pit. John used to work close to the bottom – he actually KNEW the guy that I told you about yesterday that went crazy – and he almost never talked about it. I got the impression he saw or heard something he shouldn’t and that he was honestly afraid of the things going on down the mine. If he killed himself, which I’m not convinced it was as plain as that, I think he did it because he was scared. He had a lot to live for, but whatever he knew was either too dangerous for him to stay alive, or too terrifying for him to want to continue living.”\n\nI didn’t say anything for a moment after that, but instead let what he said hang in the air between us like the blade of a guillotine. Although I hadn’t said it outright to Tim, I believed we shared the same feeling that whomever was running the mine had more control over our lives than we cared for. If he crossed them, he would be vaporized from existence – and me along with him. Simply being a part of the conversation that was happening was enough, I think, to merit action by the upper echelons. The moment he sat down, hell, maybe even the moment we met in the Filling Station, our lives were already in danger.\n\nI agreed to help him.\n\nThere was no point in waiting to carry out the plan that Tim had devised. Being that we were likely already on the radar, waiting even 24 hours could mean that one or both of us would go missing before carrying out the plan.\n\nTim’s plan was simple, really, and it started with me feigning a stomach ache. I was so nervous it wasn’t hard to force myself to throw up, and after making a mess all over the dirt, I was sent home by my supervisor.\n\nI drove nearly home, just as Tim instructed, then double-backed up the highway and turned my radio to the channel I was told.\n\nHe’d been very specific on where I should wait to hear from him. It was a few miles down a dirt road in Herriman. I knew what he’d been planning to do, but I didn’t believe he’d actually do it until I saw the dust being kicked up on the other side of a hill.\n\nOne of the big Kennecott trucks – the kind that goes down to the bottom of the mine and drives through the tunnels – came up and over the hill with Tim in the driver’s seat. I sat in my truck, watching as he drove the truck past the road where I sat and up a small canyon.\n\nIn the years that he’d worked for the mine, he’d made some friends, as he put it, and those friends had managed to get him the keys to one of the trucks that he’d otherwise need special clearance to drive.\n\nI heard his voice on the radio then, and I nearly jumped out of my skin.\n\n“You there?”\n\nI told him I was.\n\n“Keep the channel open, and don’t use my name. I’m going to report to you what I see as I go down this tunnel. No matter what happens to me, I want you to share with everyone what I tell you. Understand?”\n\nI told him I did.\n\nThe next forty-five minutes was completely silent. I sat and played games on my phone and listened to music, but I couldn’t help the knot forming in my stomach. I thought for a moment that perhaps I didn’t actually fake being sick. I was hot and feverish from the anxiety and my stomach bile felt like it was going to burn a hole right through me.\n\nWhen the voice came over the radio again, I’d almost begun to give up hope that he’d made it.\n\n“I’m in.”\n\nFrom this point forward, as requested by Tim, I will transcribe everything that was said over the radio.\n\nTIM: I’m in the tunnel now. They searched the truck and let me in. I passed two of those guard dogs they talk about on the signs in the lower tunnels. They’re big fuckers – I wouldn’t want to be on the wrong end of them.\n\nI don’t think they’ve been mining these tunnels. There are huge veins of copper and gold that don’t look like they’ll ever be excavated. I think they’re working on getting deeper into the mountains.\n\nSILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES\n\nTIM: I just saw a caution sign, sort of like the one in the pit, but this one is different. It says:\n\nCAUTION\n\nGloves and protective masks must be worn from this point forward. Under no circumstances are you to remove them.\n\nAll fossils and artifacts must be reported immediately upon excavation.\n\nRio Tinto accepts no responsibility for any physical, mental, or emotional damage past this point. \n\nSILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES\n\nTIM: I’m still in the truck and I’ve reached a big room. I’ve got a mask and gloves from the cab of the truck. I’m gonna get out and take a look here.\n\nIt looks sort of like a bomb shelter. There are these barrels that look like whiskey barrels all over the place. I think they’re Cedar maybe.\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever seen a vein of copper this big. It’s like they dug the room out of the stuff. The walls and everything are almost all completely unrefined copper.\n\nI can’t seem to open any of the barrels, but there’s something weird about them. I feel warm, but not on the outside.\n\nSILENCE FOR APPROXIMATELY TEN MINUTES\n\nTIM: Someone’s following me. I can hear them talking to me. They know my name.\n\nSILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES\n\nTIM: I’m trying to come out now, but he won’t stop following me. He wants me to take off my helmet.\n\nSILENCE\n\nI’m going to take off my helmet.\n\nME: Don’t take off your helmet! I’m on my way.\n\nSILENCE\n\n*Inaudible audio*\n\nNote: Tim began to speak in another voice here. I could hear his voice in it, but I do not believe that it was him speaking. I believe it was something or someone else speaking THROUGH him.\n\nVOICE: Come unto me.\n\nME: What was that?\n\nVOICE: Come unto me my child and partake of the manna of heaven. For with it, ye shall know everlasting life.\n\nTIM: *Crying* I will. I will.\n\nME: Get out of there!\n\nVOICE: Timothy. Look upon me and see.\n\nTIM: Screaming.\n\nVOICE: Do you believe in God?\n\nRADIO STATIC.\n\nSILENCE.\n\n \n\nI haven’t seen or heard from Tim since then.\n\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6mmzxz/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecot_copper_mine/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6nayvc/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecot_copper_mine/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6o24nv/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecott_copper_mine/)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoverHawk/comments/6ob1fm/safety_precautions_in_the_kennecott_copper_mine/)",

      "body": "I am a mining engineer originally. I don’t really know what I am any more. Anything involving technology or business improvement or data/reporting or project management in mining that someone will pay me for.\n\nBut pretty much every interview these days is a behavioural interview. Especially at Rio or BHP.\n\nExample question might be “Tell me about a time you had to work with a difficult team member.”\n\nUsing the STAR response would be something like:\nSituation - during 3rd your we had a group assignment to design a solar powered vehicle\nTask - Jimmy Bob was assigned responsibility for looking after designing the doors but wasn’t turning up to group meetings.\nAction - Jane Blogs and I went and found him at the social club and had a long conversation about responsibility and that he was letting the team down. We explained that he needed to have the door design done by Friday or we were going to have to speak to the lecturer.\nResponse - Lazy Bones McGee thanked us for being so honest with him and apologised for letting us down. Everyone at the social club stood up and clapped and L.B. McGee went straight home and finished the door design that night.\n\nI haven’t had a job interview for years but when preparing I usually just write out as many examples as I have of when I have faced a challenge  that I have overcome or performed well at something or whatever. Then just figure out what applies to whatever question they ask. Don’t feel awkward about taking some time to compose your thoughts and think of a good example. Otherwise you will be tempted to speak in generalities. Remember, even a bad story is better than generalities.",

      "post_selftext": "Hello, I'm sure this has been posted before, I appreciate any additional info\n\nI'm currently27 years of age at a local community college in British Columbia taking Millwright Foundations, and previously I was working at a sawmill for a year doing clean-up / Sparkwatch. \n\nI took the oiler apprenticeship test through my local sawmill and failed by two questions overall. It was kind of disheartening, but I decided to go take the program through my local community college as honestly I didn't have a huge understanding of trade work in general, and I had some free time due to layoff at a lot of the sawmills in BC, mine included. I've learned a lot since I started in February, and my graduation is coming up soon. I'll be more than likely landing an overall mark of 85%.\n\nI have family and friends who also live in Kitimat near Rio Tinto Alcan / LNG, so it wouldn't be to difficult to move if need-be. I'd also move anywhere in BC that wasn't too much further north than I already am. Depending on the job of course.\n\nRecently, the sawmill has stated they were opening up again soon, and they are looking to hire me on as a level 1 millwright, @ $38.75 / hour. 7am - 3:30pm, M-W(24 hours a week) for now, schedule likely to change as production ramps up. I am having a bit of concern as the job industry for sawmills seems to be up and down, and I don't really want to be stuck in that loop. They also don't have a great deal of red seal millwrights, and I really want to get the best opportunity to learn that I can. They often open and close during the Christmas months, log shortages combined with extremely cold weather on an old mill that hasn't been updated in years.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is, does anyone have recommendations here? \n\nIs joining the BC Millwright union my best bet, and claiming EI till I can find employment?(I didn't collect it as I went to school, so I'm still entitled to around 15 weeks. after I've finished school if I haven't started working), or should I go to the sawmill, and start my millwright apprenticeship and see where the mill goes, if it ends up closing or keeping production going?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Go back to an old sawmill to start Level 1 apprenticeship, or go through with the BC millwright union and hope for a better opportunity.",

I’d rather hire someone that is willing to work and gain experience over someone who is willing to stay on EI for a specific unknown opportunity. Everyday you work as an apprentice you become a more valuable employee. I do think it’s good that your willing to move to achieve your goal of becoming a millwright as finding a full time/permanent stable job as a millwright apprentice in BC right now can be difficult to find.",

Congratulations though I hope you crush the interview. \n\nIf it's a one way interview the best advice I can give is pay close attention to the instructions and question parameters. I tanked a one-way interview with Newmont by failing to notice the question had switched from unlimited response attempts to three response attempts.\n\nAgain, congratulations on getting to the second stage and good luck!\n",

Unsure of exact rates but it is significantly (more than double) higher than an LE gets here, despite only working half the year. \n2. No idea about their Union situation. I think Rio are leading the charge with regards to automation but still haven't got there. It's probably inevitable but I don't think it's happening soon. \n3. As I understand you start out as a \"casual\", meaning you're not a permanent employee and if you're not up to scratch they can send you on your way at a minutes notice. Keep your nose clean and you'll eventually be made permanent, which AFAIK means you actually take a slight cut in your hourly rate but in addition you accumulate paid annual leave, get the superannuation contributions, get accommodation provided on site etc. No idea how long this takes, hopefully some current staff can give you an idea of what it's like at the moment. Unsurprisingly, of the guys I know who went there the good operators who keep their heads down and act professionally are all still there, and the ones who had checkered pasts aren't. \n4. Port Headland is really in the middle of nowhere, Australia is as big as the states but about 99% of the population are on the east coast or in a couple of other cities like Perth and Adelaide, the rest of it is nearly empty. I'm not sure what life there is like but I imagine Perth would be a much better place to raise a family. I know people who fly back to NZ for their two weeks off (working the usual 14 on 14 off), Perth is a lot closer and you'd spend a lot less time (and money) traveling too. \n\nI imagine it's a pretty big leap for you to consider making, but it can be very worthwhile if you're disciplined and motivated to make it work. Being away from home is tough on the family (one guy I know there has six kids!) but you could always make a plan to do it for X years then find a job with an easier schedule closer to home.

      "body": "I’ve spent a lot of time in the Pilbara and I’ve had friends work there.  Here is info for you:\n1) Pay- If you get the job, you’d be paid really well. Just keep in mind the exchange rates as that skews things.  There is a reason they pay well, which is because people don’t want the job and the cost of living is really high. \n\n2) Unions- I don’t think so. Australia is generally more pro labor so I don’t think unions are as  required as in Canada and USA.  Rio Tinto is leading the charge for driverless trains. The others in the area (BHP, FMG, Roy Hill) are likely 5 years away from it. \n\n3) Respect - Yes and no. Australia has a much more pro labor mentality so people are treated with respect at a greater level than Class Is.  But an interesting thing about the Pilbara mines is that the mine-railroad-port is all one company.  Generally the mine people are the highest class within the company and the railroad is the lowest.  The railroad is seen as just a conveyer belt. \n\n4) Where to live - There are pros and cons to each.  Living in Port Hedland has a lot of problems for families, which is why not many families live there.  Nothing to do, so-so schools, have to fly to go anywhere. Housing is crazy expensive for what it is.  Most family people do FIFO.  The amount of time varies but generally 2 to 4 weeks on then time off.  That is rough on families too. Lots of divorces. But when your off, you get to spend a lot of time with your family.  The Perth airport is bizarre on Monday mornings with crowds of workers in high vis shirts swamping the airport. Perth is expensive too, but at least it’s somewhat more a regular city.  \n\nBest of luck.  Happy to answer any other questions.",

Courses cancelled. Research abandoned.\n\nLet me tell you how.\n\nThe governing body of the ANU is a complete shitshow. But this national treasure is not alone.\n\nThe governance of universities in this country needs a colonoscopy, resection and reconstruction.\n\nThe good news is that the minister Jason Clare could step in at ANU because that university is the only one firmly in the federal remit within its own specific legislation, the ANU Act.\n\nBell resigned on Thursday, days into white-hot anticipation about when she would finally relent.\n\nBetween the onset of the anticipation and the announcement were hours and hours and days and days of negotiation of how much she would get to leave. What would be the deal?\n\nThe speculation about whether Julie Bishop would go too hasn’t yet subsided – despite the former foreign minister’s firm announcement at an all-staff town hall that she wasn’t going anywhere.\n\nShe’s hanging on for dear life. She must find it hard to go from institution to institution, knowing she isn’t wanted.\n\nBut as multiple people tell me across the university, it’s not really about Bishop or Bell.\n\nThere are just shocking symptoms of a system that’s stuffed. It appears that no one in senior management at the university understands it needs to listen to those who make up the heart and soul of what was once our leading university.\n\nThis is not Rio Tinto or BHP. Universities are a public good and those in charge need to understand that holy responsibility.\n\nAnd a word to the wise. When you appoint a vice-chancellor, it needs to be an academic who is a people person.\n\nThat may sound trite, but the ability to relate to those you lead is crucial. I’d argue that’s their main job, to connect with staff and students. Of course, that person also functions as the chief executive officer – but we see across some universities that they handle the juggle much better than others. Take, for example, Attila Brungs now at UNSW and formerly at UTS. He could make tough decisions but was never a monster.\n\nThe problems at ANU extend well beyond individuals, beyond the Bishops and the Bells.\n\n“There is an overall consensus that we must have more accountability, more transparency, and more involvement of staff,” says Carolyn Hendricks, professor at the Crawford School of Public Policy.\n\nShe is part of a university-wide solution to the current debacle, what students and staff call the ANU Governance Project.\n\nHendricks describes it as bottom-up, conversations, kitchen table chats, governance workshops. It began in August and already Bishop has had to sign on to at least listen to what the people say. Let’s see how that pans out.\n\nHendricks, an expert in democratic governance, says: “We’ve experienced incoherent decision making – Renew ANU \\[The university’s own change management process\\] is running endless consultations but it’s been along the lines of: ‘here’s what we are planning. Give us feedback on the wallpaper while we dismantle the house’.”\n\nThe ANU has so many internal experts, you’d wonder why they couldn’t engage some of those in this hideous process. Marija Taflaga, an academic at ANU who has undertaken research fellowships at both the Australian Parliamentary Library and the Australian Museum of Democracy and has a clutch of ARC grants, says the ANU Act has to shift.\n\n“We must change the way the nominations committee to council is constituted, to include both staff and students as a matter of law,” she says.\n\nRight now, it is entirely controlled by the chancellor. Taflaga is also calling on the minister to establish a university senate that will facilitate a proper accountability chain from staff and students and the public all the way through to council and university managers.\n\nOne of the leaders of the ANU Governance Project, Jessie Moritz, an expert on authoritarian governance, was at the town hall meeting on Thursday where Bishop told staff she would listen to what the project says.\n\n“She will be supporting us as we engage with council. This is an excellent step forward for governance at ANU,” says Moritz.\n\n“We could change everyone at the top but we would still need systems change.”\n\nCan Bishop oversee meaningful change? Now that’s a story for a few months down the track.\n\n *Jenna Price is a Canberra Times columnist and a visiting fellow at the Australian National University.*",

Courses cancelled. Research abandoned.\n\nLet me tell you how.\n\nThe governing body of the ANU is a complete shitshow. But this national treasure is not alone.\n\nThe governance of universities in this country needs a colonoscopy, resection and reconstruction.\n\nThe good news is that the minister Jason Clare could step in at ANU because that university is the only one firmly in the federal remit within its own specific legislation, the ANU Act.\n\nBell resigned on Thursday, days into white-hot anticipation about when she would finally relent.\n\nBetween the onset of the anticipation and the announcement were hours and hours and days and days of negotiation of how much she would get to leave. What would be the deal?\n\nThe speculation about whether Julie Bishop would go too hasn’t yet subsided – despite the former foreign minister’s firm announcement at an all-staff town hall that she wasn’t going anywhere.\n\nShe’s hanging on for dear life. She must find it hard to go from institution to institution, knowing she isn’t wanted.\n\nBut as multiple people tell me across the university, it’s not really about Bishop or Bell.\n\nThere are just shocking symptoms of a system that’s stuffed. It appears that no one in senior management at the university understands it needs to listen to those who make up the heart and soul of what was once our leading university.\n\nThis is not Rio Tinto or BHP. Universities are a public good and those in charge need to understand that holy responsibility.\n\nAnd a word to the wise. When you appoint a vice-chancellor, it needs to be an academic who is a people person.\n\nThat may sound trite, but the ability to relate to those you lead is crucial. I’d argue that’s their main job, to connect with staff and students. Of course, that person also functions as the chief executive officer – but we see across some universities that they handle the juggle much better than others. Take, for example, Attila Brungs now at UNSW and formerly at UTS. He could make tough decisions but was never a monster.\n\nThe problems at ANU extend well beyond individuals, beyond the Bishops and the Bells.\n\n“There is an overall consensus that we must have more accountability, more transparency, and more involvement of staff,” says Carolyn Hendricks, professor at the Crawford School of Public Policy.\n\nShe is part of a university-wide solution to the current debacle, what students and staff call the ANU Governance Project.\n\nHendricks describes it as bottom-up, conversations, kitchen table chats, governance workshops. It began in August and already Bishop has had to sign on to at least listen to what the people say. Let’s see how that pans out.\n\nHendricks, an expert in democratic governance, says: “We’ve experienced incoherent decision making – Renew ANU \\[The university’s own change management process\\] is running endless consultations but it’s been along the lines of: ‘here’s what we are planning. Give us feedback on the wallpaper while we dismantle the house’.”\n\nThe ANU has so many internal experts, you’d wonder why they couldn’t engage some of those in this hideous process. Marija Taflaga, an academic at ANU who has undertaken research fellowships at both the Australian Parliamentary Library and the Australian Museum of Democracy and has a clutch of ARC grants, says the ANU Act has to shift.\n\n“We must change the way the nominations committee to council is constituted, to include both staff and students as a matter of law,” she says.\n\nRight now, it is entirely controlled by the chancellor. Taflaga is also calling on the minister to establish a university senate that will facilitate a proper accountability chain from staff and students and the public all the way through to council and university managers.\n\nOne of the leaders of the ANU Governance Project, Jessie Moritz, an expert on authoritarian governance, was at the town hall meeting on Thursday where Bishop told staff she would listen to what the project says.\n\n“She will be supporting us as we engage with council. This is an excellent step forward for governance at ANU,” says Moritz.\n\n“We could change everyone at the top but we would still need systems change.”\n\nCan Bishop oversee meaningful change?

      "body": "You are correct. Bell has gone (well, not really as she will apparently take up her distinguished professor position in the School of Cybernetics, talk about rewarding failure). Bell's behaviour as a senior leader before becoming VC involved bending the university to her will, allowing her to set up a school (3AI, and then Cybernetics) that was not financially sustainable and no one really understood. That school still exists and is a symbol of what is wrong at the ANU. But Bell is just the high profile example of this behaviour, there are other examples of Deans and Research School Directors who bend the university to their will and build or prop their particular research focus, without any transparent assessment of whether the university needs this focus and whether it is going to be financially sustainable. So Bell is gone, but is the root cause of this mess gone? I'd say no, and I wonder if the ANU Governance Project has any appetite for tackling this root problem. It requires complete transparency about income and expenditure at the school level, and this will reveal exactly who is bending the university to their will: Bell was just the most recent high profile example.",

Courses cancelled. Research abandoned.\n\nLet me tell you how.\n\nThe governing body of the ANU is a complete shitshow. But this national treasure is not alone.\n\nThe governance of universities in this country needs a colonoscopy, resection and reconstruction.\n\nThe good news is that the minister Jason Clare could step in at ANU because that university is the only one firmly in the federal remit within its own specific legislation, the ANU Act.\n\nBell resigned on Thursday, days into white-hot anticipation about when she would finally relent.\n\nBetween the onset of the anticipation and the announcement were hours and hours and days and days of negotiation of how much she would get to leave. What would be the deal?\n\nThe speculation about whether Julie Bishop would go too hasn’t yet subsided – despite the former foreign minister’s firm announcement at an all-staff town hall that she wasn’t going anywhere.\n\nShe’s hanging on for dear life. She must find it hard to go from institution to institution, knowing she isn’t wanted.\n\nBut as multiple people tell me across the university, it’s not really about Bishop or Bell.\n\nThere are just shocking symptoms of a system that’s stuffed. It appears that no one in senior management at the university understands it needs to listen to those who make up the heart and soul of what was once our leading university.\n\nThis is not Rio Tinto or BHP. Universities are a public good and those in charge need to understand that holy responsibility.\n\nAnd a word to the wise. When you appoint a vice-chancellor, it needs to be an academic who is a people person.\n\nThat may sound trite, but the ability to relate to those you lead is crucial. I’d argue that’s their main job, to connect with staff and students. Of course, that person also functions as the chief executive officer – but we see across some universities that they handle the juggle much better than others. Take, for example, Attila Brungs now at UNSW and formerly at UTS. He could make tough decisions but was never a monster.\n\nThe problems at ANU extend well beyond individuals, beyond the Bishops and the Bells.\n\n“There is an overall consensus that we must have more accountability, more transparency, and more involvement of staff,” says Carolyn Hendricks, professor at the Crawford School of Public Policy.\n\nShe is part of a university-wide solution to the current debacle, what students and staff call the ANU Governance Project.\n\nHendricks describes it as bottom-up, conversations, kitchen table chats, governance workshops. It began in August and already Bishop has had to sign on to at least listen to what the people say. Let’s see how that pans out.\n\nHendricks, an expert in democratic governance, says: “We’ve experienced incoherent decision making – Renew ANU \\[The university’s own change management process\\] is running endless consultations but it’s been along the lines of: ‘here’s what we are planning. Give us feedback on the wallpaper while we dismantle the house’.”\n\nThe ANU has so many internal experts, you’d wonder why they couldn’t engage some of those in this hideous process. Marija Taflaga, an academic at ANU who has undertaken research fellowships at both the Australian Parliamentary Library and the Australian Museum of Democracy and has a clutch of ARC grants, says the ANU Act has to shift.\n\n“We must change the way the nominations committee to council is constituted, to include both staff and students as a matter of law,” she says.\n\nRight now, it is entirely controlled by the chancellor. Taflaga is also calling on the minister to establish a university senate that will facilitate a proper accountability chain from staff and students and the public all the way through to council and university managers.\n\nOne of the leaders of the ANU Governance Project, Jessie Moritz, an expert on authoritarian governance, was at the town hall meeting on Thursday where Bishop told staff she would listen to what the project says.\n\n“She will be supporting us as we engage with council. This is an excellent step forward for governance at ANU,” says Moritz.\n\n“We could change everyone at the top but we would still need systems change.”\n\nCan Bishop oversee meaningful change? Now that’s a story for a few months down the track.\n\n *Jenna Price is a Canberra Times columnist and a visiting fellow at the Australian National University.*",

      "body": "Universities are entitled to some government funding but the question is how much, and how is it used? The fact that universities are in crisis and successive governments are unwilling to step in means that the argument that universities provide a public service \"like roads and metros\" doesn't wash with governments, because it doesn't wash with voters and taxpayers.\n\nAddition: Universities provide heavily subsidised education services to Australian students, subsidised by the Australian taxpayer and international students paying full fees. Much of the benefit is captured privately by the Australian students receiving the subsidised education: it helps them to get jobs and higher incomes (and yes this will benefit Australia, if they use their skills in jobs that benefit Australia) and/or else it helps them pursue their activist causes (which may benefit Australia, but it greatly depends on the cause). So the taxpayer and international students are subsidising Australian students who gain privately. This puts an upper limit on how much subsidisation universities can reasonably expect. This is why HECS was devised by ANU economist Bruce Chapman: income-contingent loans so working class taxpayers wouldn't have to bear the full cost of a middle class ANU student doing a double major in law and music practice.",

      "body": "So many of these comments focus on education, e.g. ta9800's post above. Of course, in the long-run a university must balance its books but adequate government subsidies are essential as higher education (and research!) is a public good. Universities tend to undertake basic research because the private sector tends not to. Why? Because the immediate payoff is not obvious and the fruits from basic research often benefit wider society. In econo-speak, its a pure public good. Leave the provision of a public good to the market and it will be under-provided. Australia, compared to its peers (e.g. the OECD average), pays significantly less on basic research (and R&D overall, for that matter), and the gap is widening. Australian governments need to pour money into the higher education system, thus reducing its fraught reliance on student fees, especially from overseas.  \nOf course, there is fat to be cut in many universities but this mostly resides in the administrative areas, especially at the senior levels. The ratio of admin staff to academic staff is completely lopsided nowadays!",

Marija Taflaga, an academic at ANU who has undertaken research fellowships at both the Australian Parliamentary Library and the Australian Museum of Democracy and has a clutch of ARC grants, says the ANU Act has to shift.\n\n“We must change the way the nominations committee to council is constituted, to include both staff and students as a matter of law,” she says.\n\nRight now, it is entirely controlled by the chancellor. Taflaga is also calling on the minister to establish a university senate that will facilitate a proper accountability chain from staff and students and the public all the way through to council and university managers.\n\nOne of the leaders of the ANU Governance Project, Jessie Moritz, an expert on authoritarian governance, was at the town hall meeting on Thursday where Bishop told staff she would listen to what the project says.\n\n“She will be supporting us as we engage with council. This is an excellent step forward for governance at ANU,” says Moritz.\n\n“We could change everyone at the top but we would still need systems change.”\n\nCan Bishop oversee meaningful change?

The employer fired them the day before a report was released showing widespread behaviour consistent with what they were reporting. \n\nAt the unfair dismissal hearing, they were trying to force that person to sign an NDA, they ended up dropping the unfair dismissal because they felt signing an NDA would have led to another attempt to end their life. \n\nIt seems that the legal profession can not comprehend that 6 months' pay doesn't not negate the negative effects of the lifelong burden of signing an NDA. \n\nThey tried to raise this issue with Tony Bourke's office and their local ALP member, but both of them didn't want to hear it and Tony Bourke's office seemed to think it was not an issue. \n\nThey were devastated that the pro worker party was not even open to hearing the mental toll taken on the during the process and how NDAs can cause further harm.",

Which provided protection. I said there is lots of documentation that speaking about your injury to friends and family has a positive impact.

ISS I think? \n\nBoth companies sites operate with a large degree of independence from corporate. And some toe the company line more than others. My experience is across 4 rio and 3 BHP sites. \n\nRio has a lower base pay rate than BHP. But the site allowances are higher. In my experience they are both pretty even overall. Rio’s benefits shit all over BHP’s. Except if you can get big points to spend. BHP’s points store is fucking superb. I still love my vacuum cleaner!\n\nThis is a highly subjective comment made purely from memory and my personal experiences.",

      "body": "I feel like that assumption is fuelled by the major miners having policies that include gender quotas. I’m positive there are many great women in mining who excel at their jobs, I’ve worked with many of them and am proud to call them mates. It is also fuelled by the women who gloat about getting the job and having job security because they’re a diversity hire. I have unfortunately worked with many of them. Until we abolish all the bullshit and hire and fire based purely on merit, we aren’t going to see this go away. \n\nWe both know that nobody or at least very few people in mining, care about gender, race, sexual preference or identity. Yet we are regularly subjected to idiots who can’t do their jobs a best, and people who are hazardous to be working with at worst. These companies need to rethink the basis on which they are hiring people to do what can be very dangerous work. \n\nAnyways, love it or hate it that’s my two cents worth.",

You won't lose out to either in general\n\nIf you want a well thought out program, lots of support and hand holding go for an iron ore program. Usually much larger cohort, more resources. Clearly defined scope and responsibilties, which can be good or bad. You can end up feeling just like a number. \n\nThe programs for ex-iron ore commodities generally aren't as good (I.e. less support, less resources, more sink-or-swim), even within Rio and BHP. That being said if you want to grow your career faster, gain leadership experience and step into leadership roles, I would choose ex-iron ore positions. Usually not as well funded, but you do everything and anything. \n\nEither choice is good though. Just splitting hairs here to be honest.",

I found the work pretty boring once I learnt the system, the auto trucks were more fun than the people one, ones with real people often dumped stuff in the wrong location and complained a lot. You could also look for a job with caterpillar where you become an ‘expert’ but really just a glorified trainer and help set up mines and train people. There software has potential but the systems to improve and submit ideas are lacking. I’ve heard of a few preferring Komatsu(?) system but never got to see it.",

      "post_selftext": "Hi, I am a geologist with 5 years of experience. I went to a couple different schools for undergrad. Santa Barbara City College has an amazing program for those looking for a cheap program with a ton of field trips and a field course before you transfer to a 4-year school. I transferred to Northern Arizona University, and graduated from there with just your basic geology degree. While in school I did a thesis on carbonate sediments in the Nankai trough subduction zone, but other than that I did nothing really outstanding in school. \n\nRegardless, I got a short-term position with Geotemps at the grand canyon right after school. I was hired to classify something like 2000 mineral samples that the park had confiscated from a guy who had been stealing from one of the old copper mines in the park. I spent aboout 9 months living at the Grand Canyon going through these incredibly rare minerals/possibly \"new\" minerals and trying to figure out what they were/classify them/ organize them for the archives. I also supplemented my income by doing lectures on the formation of the Grand Canyon to tour buses. It was an awesome summer.\n\nThen, while working there, I got hired for my current project. It is copper-moly mine that is proposed to open sometime in the next 10-15 years. It will be an underground block-cave mine, and I am part of the shaping team. This prospect is owned by Rio Tinto. I won't mention the name of the mine, and there are some things I won't be able to answer because I'm not sanctioned by work to write about this- but you can figure out which prospect it is pretty easily from the details I have given. There is a website if you want to find out more about the project.

First off- the deposit is not at Apache leap, it is behind Apache Leap and we are not affecting the leap at all. When you say a defense budget earmark- I assume you mean the land exchange? \n\nWe've had the project and owned the land for the mine itself for years, since we bought it from the old Magma mine that was the reason for the town's existence. The land exchange is adjacent to the mine we have planned, and may or may not have minerals in it, we haven't drilled there yet to be sure. I am not privy to the workings and legalities etc so I really can't say why it was included in what bill.\nI can say that most people in this area are very supportive of the mine. We have done a lot of cleanup of the old mine workings that we were not responsible for. We provide money to the struggling town, and we are working to provide access to climbing spots that are being affected. Most of the opposition is either a) opposed to all mining/ just don't want mining to occur where they know about it- which is just not realistic, or b) believe that it is native american land. That is just false. This land is NOT Native American land.",

      "body": "Well, permitting takes forever, and that is assuming there is full 100% support from the community. As you can see in my above comment, even in districts that are traditionally known for mining, in a state known as the \"Copper State\"- there is opposition. You have to make sure the community knows what you are doing, you have to do environmental impact studies, you have to go through the NEPA process etc. This alone can take 20 years- a mine is a big project and they use a lot of land so you have to prove that you will be as careful as possible with the land.\n\nThen there are the practical aspects. Mines are super expensive to build- that money has to come from somewhere often investors. In order to explain why you need so much money,  you have to prove that you can get a return on the money- which means a drilling program. Drilling can take a while to get a good idea of the shape of a deposit, especially an underground one without any surface outcrops like ours. Then you have to take all that data and model it up just to get approval to start building. Then building the mine takes a while- ours will be a block cave so there is a lot of infrastructure that has to be constructed. Things like a tailings pile, conveyance system for moving ore, etc- all of it has to be planned and accounted for in advance, because a) you need to get it permitted and b) you need to be able to prove you can make a profit or investors won't pay.",

      "body": "Congrats!\n1) The transition from undergrad was surprisingly easy. We have a good training program, and for the most part there are really only 4 or 5 ore minerals that we work with regularly- so learning those is quick and painless.   We also have some required reading- several scientific papers etc, that help to get everyone kind of up to speed. \n\n2) So with the training and everything, I think maybe it was 6 months or so until I kind of understood the deposit/ how things worked, and obviously I am still increasing ore body knowledge, just at a slower pace now.\n\n3) The work- not really. Core logging is tedious and boring. Sampling and all that is ok, but a lot of the \"thinking\" part of the job is being replaced with technology. So for example,  I still do my copper estimations, but they get replaced by real data from assay scans. It starts to make you feel like you are just a tech. There are limited opportunities for projects or research, but for me not enough to outweigh the boredom. That is kind of why I started the website. I'm pretty bored and I'd like to move up to some new challenges, and really upset that the career advice from my management is just to wait it out for those rare opportunities. As For the people-kind of hit or miss. There are some very bright people in mining, and I have made some very good friends. There are also a lot of assholes, and being a woman I think this industry (and specific people I work with) has some problems with sexism. That's what I get for going into a male-dominated field though.\n\n4) I spend maybe 2-3 days a year, sadly. I wish it was more. But our deposit doesn't have a surface outcrop, so all our work stems from drill core. And, Rio Tinto has a separate department that does all the exploration work.\n\n5) I've never been in o&G so it's hard to be sure, but my friends in the field seem to make similar pay, but the work is a lot \"dirtier\". Maybe you live on the rig, whereas we work from a core shed and dont spend a lot of time on the rigs themselves. We keep all our core that isn't sampled, which I believe is different from O&G. And obviously, our rocks are totally different. We have a lot more complexity with ore bodies and porphyries than just simple sed/strat stuff. I didnt know what I wanted to do when I graduated but mining has been a reasonably good fit, especially now that I'm a Mom, although I'm really lucky to have been hired on a project near to a major city.",

      "body": "1. I applied through a temp agency. We always hire through them for the first 6 months. I can't speak for other mines, but here and at the mines I have visited through work, about half of the geologists have a masters and half have just a bachelors. For what you start out doing (prepping core, doing quick logs, etc), a bachelor's is more than sufficient. Those with a master's get paid more for the same work though. Experience+ enthusiasm seems to be what gets you the furthest.\n\n2) I hope so! Obviously the mining industry is kind of fluctuating. We have managed several bad market downturns in the past 15 years or so without needing to layoff geologists, although it has come close. We have a huge deposit with a good grade, so we are fortunate to be able to expect to continue being funded by investors. Because the mine is underground, they expect to employ a team of geologists through the life of the mine (t least 50 years or so) as they continue shaping, although it might mean doing more underground work once the mine opens. But I expect if I wanted to stay that long, I could have a job til I retire.\n\n3)Thank you!",

There is a website if you want to find out more about the project. Personally, I do a lot of logging core, sampling management, presentations of findings, etc. Standard stuff.\n\nFinally, lately I have been exploring opportunities for side businesses/ outside advancement opportunities in geology. To that end, I made a website to try to provide geologists with information. The site is professionalgeo.com, feel free to check it out although it's still a work in progress.

I also supplemented my income by doing lectures on the formation of the Grand Canyon to tour buses. It was an awesome summer.\n\nThen, while working there, I got hired for my current project. It is copper-moly mine that is proposed to open sometime in the next 10-15 years. It will be an underground block-cave mine, and I am part of the shaping team. This prospect is owned by Rio Tinto. I won't mention the name of the mine, and there are some things I won't be able to answer because I'm not sanctioned by work to write about this- but you can figure out which prospect it is pretty easily from the details I have given. There is a website if you want to find out more about the project. Personally, I do a lot of logging core, sampling management, presentations of findings, etc. Standard stuff.\n\nFinally, lately I have been exploring opportunities for side businesses/ outside advancement opportunities in geology. To that end, I made a website to try to provide geologists with information. The site is professionalgeo.com, feel free to check it out although it's still a work in progress. I just felt frustrated with the attitude of \"oh well to get promoted you just wait 20 years\". Also, I've never taken the ASBOG, so that is going to be my study site too.\n\nSorry this got so long...I'll be answering questions all week...Ask me anything!",

It was a late addition to the bill because there was a similar project that we were allowed to kind of latch on to. It did happen quickly but I don't think it was under the table- there were certainly protests about it going on in town at the time so the opposition knew about it. Bottom line is, we are really trying to work with the different opposing communites to allay their concerns and everything we do is very transparent (our mine plan of operations is even posted on our website). This is a really great moneymaker for the area, and Rio Tinto seems like a company with integrity so I feel really proud to have been a part of it. ",

      "body": "Well it depends on the price of copper obviously. Right now, it's looking pretty fortunate that we don't have a producing mine. Once you start production, its pretty expensive to sit on your heels and wait for the price of copper to go up- which is why a lot of companies are having a really tough time right now- they have to produce because otherwiise they are wasting money, but they are making a lot less profit than was anticipated/operating at a loss. Vs we can just slowly build our infrastructure, expecting that the price of copper will go up by the time we produce.  I think the current estimate is that the first 5-10 years of the 50+ year mine life will be just paying our investors back, and we are targeting the highest grade zones to be mined first.",

We pull the core we want (usually a diameter between 5-2 inches), then seal the holes at the surface, although we can usually go back and reopen if we need to. Usually we prefer not to leave casing because its expensive, and like tpm319 said, the rock is generally hard enough, but it does happen.",

This stuff is heavy for the complete runs, and at some point the hole reaches a depth where its just too heavy with the weight of the drill string and everything, so we switch to HQ/ 63.5 mm. We'd prefer to drill the whole hole in HQ because its just sturdier and easier to see features, but often we again have weight issues (if we are deep) or get stuck rods. If we get stuck we leave the HQ casing, reduce to a smaller size (NQ), and keep going. Most of our holes will have to reduce to NQ at some point, we get stuck a lot (pretty faulted/messy rocks) and it seems to be easier to maneuver. Finally, we sometimes are forced to reduce to BQ/ 36.5mm (like if we get stuck rods but we are already using NQ rods), but we don't like to because that hole size is too small to fit our survey tools so we have to \"log blind\", plus it breaks a lot more usually.",

Same in the mornings cos we’d be up before the sun.\n\nCouldn’t even begin to estimate the amount vile comments I received, the wildly inappropriate and non consensual touching, and the bullying I’d cop during work because I’d turned down their advances. Even from my own bosses at times. They’d then find my socials and message me in the middle of the night on my days off, just straight up weird creepy shit. \n\n I quickly learnt to just cop it or lose my job cos the guys definitely weren’t going to be the ones punished.

Or at least to how it is in Canada. \n\nAs a male, I've applied hundreds of times for company jobs after extensive contracting work in that specific mining industry, on half a dozen different mine sites operated by that company, and contract work in other mining industries.  \n\nA former female coworker who just got her trade certification applied her first time, interview, job offer. Zero mining experience. And, at THE top choice mine for the fact you can see it from the city. Mine money, home every night. \n\nGranted, she is a very talented sparky and fully deserves that job, and will excel at it. \nShe was a 4th year apprentice when I worked with her on a small shutdown job with a mostly journeyman crew. We all told her she needs to pursue mining as soon as she gets her ticket.\n\nWhile my resume and work experience checks all of the boxes and then some for the actual job, there's a couple big boxes I can not check as male outside of the visible minority group. \n\nHeck, a former male coworker of mine applied for a company job in a different mining industry. We worked together over a number of years on multiple mine sites for this other company, and were working together again when he interviewed for a position. It was during covid, so video interview. \nHe recorded the interview and showed me, asking how I think he did. \n\nThe interview started with \"tell us a bit about yourself\" and he replies with \"uhhhh, my name is Bobby and I uhhh, like electrical\". The rest of the interview was of equal caliber. \nHe got the job. A $60+/hr +OT job at that. \nAgain, he is a very talented electrician, just horrible at interviewing haha. \nHe was able to check the other most important box.",

It wasn't the first time he got away with it, either.\n\nThey do not use rape kits as often as you seem to want to believe. And, more importantly, rape kits are only able to be used if the victim decides to immediately press charges/immediately seeks medical help. As the police *did not want to investigate, and she was trying to process what had happened and was afraid for her job, do you think a rape kit magically appeared?*\n\nBecause it didn't. And she wasn't his first victim. He had a mistress who was a supervisor who helped these \"problems\" go away. He'd just never been this brazen before. She was extremely well-liked, new, and young. There were certainly never witnesses before, and not a group of them.\n\nHe was also handsome and young with a young family, so people had let a lot of the \"rumours\" slide, cause, like you, they just couldn't believe it had happened. (If you're a miner, I'm sure you understand what extremely small rural communities are like.)\n\nAnd even when there's a rape confession, like in the case of Lyndon Montgomery, who texted his rape victim that he was \"so sorry\" he'd raped her, and even when Holly had *video and photographic evidence of her rape*, a jury still fucking acquitted him, merely because she'd been drinking that day, so maybe she wanted him to break into her house and violently rape her so badly she bled over the sheets.\n\nYou not believing me doesn't make it not true.\n\nThere's plenty of people like you, who don't believe women. Who don't believe these situations happen. Who think there's some kind of justice.\n\nYou don't want to hear the truth. You don't want to hear that even if the woman in question does everything right, it doesn't guarantee the rapist will even go to jail.\n\nYou certainly don't want to hear that in that group, some of the men who witnessed the rape *wanted her to sweep what happened under the rug, and there were only a few men who actually spoke up for her.*\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for the awards.",

If you want to read about it look up BHP's involvement of the 1913 south African act. Its pretty bad and they wiped out entire towns. They have since been involved in just about every single middle eastern war with the USA being their main benefactor. Honestly don't talk about it to much, they still do take out people that talk about it.",

About three men in the group were in favour of doing something; the rest either wanted to sweep it under the rug or \"weren't sure\" because the guy was explaining he \"thought she wanted it\" and she was crying (they'd been alerted to her screams) and wondering if she'd \"done something\" to make him think she wanted it. \n\nYou know what she did? On her way to the bathroom (which was outside, away from the party) she dropped something - I think it was her phone - and bent over to pick it up. That's what she did. In that moment (he'd been following her) he pulled down her jeans, and well, I don't need to say the rest. \n\nI made so many phone calls. To the mining company. To the police. \n\nNo one cared. No one returned my calls. No one even acknowledged them. After that (not a miner, only my husband is), the only updates I ever had were from my husband. \n\nI wanted to contact his wife, and almost did, but a friend convinced me not to. She was worried that, especially with young children and his propensity for violence against women, that she'd be in a dangerous situation if she confronted him. \n\nThe only thing the mining company did was move him away to a different site, for his safety. He was fired earlier this year, but only for being shit at his job, nothing else.",

I picked defence because they had equivalent ratios to make it simple for you. I did take the female specific stats, in order to align the numbers with the mining industry for a balanced comparison 🙂\n\nYou quote me, but it's your statement, so you're having a go at me, for your stupid post lol. Which, okay glad we agree it was dumb, but kinda ironic it's your own words you have issues with.\n\n\"It's like you hooked into my use of the word \"women\" when refering[sic] to the victims, and took this to be some sort of comment motivated by gender, which is probably a projection thing or something.\" - Perfect, we've gotten to your issue. You've literally perfectly explained your problem. I stated gender once halfway through on an article about assault of women in a workplace, and you've tried to imply its motivated by gender and projectionist? Literally what you're doing with this paragraph of stupid examples is focusing/harassing someone because they correctly referenced the gender in an article and called you out for a stupid fucking idea - giving billions of dollars and collapsing an entire business/industry because a percentage of people were harmed there. Forcing tens-hundreds of thousands of people to lose their jobs, while a small minority become wealthy beyond their dreams. That's clearly setting the right message.",

      "post_selftext": "Two such breakouts in the past week or two – the report by Elizabeth Broderick into Rio Tinto, and admissions by prominent recruiters that the use of women-only candidate lists is rife – are symptoms of institutionalised discrimination that warrants a thorough review.\n\nThis war between the sexes shows every sign of becoming a disastrous “forever war” for the same reasons some military wars fall into this trap. This war has no clearly defined objective, no timelines and no exit strategy.\n\nSome activists offer up gender equality or gender equity as the endgame, but the meaning of these phrases is hotly contested and lacks any objective criteria by which we may know how and when we may reach this nirvana.\n\nCynics suspect the lack of defin­ition is deliberate. It justifies endless continuation of positive discrimination long beyond the point of legal or moral accept­ability. It’s high time, then, we agreed some rules to tell us when we no longer need positive discrimina­tion.",

Sometimes you can get real lucky and find a place with high salary and good culture. \n\nLarger companies tend not to pay as well, however they are generally more concerned with your cultural fit as an individual. They know they can attract talent without paying a premium, so they will be careful about their choice. \n\nLarger companies also have good company benefits since they can leverage economies of scale (share purchase program, medical, 401k, annual leave days, child benefits)\n\nImo rio tinto also pays less than bhp /glencore. However Rio culture tends to be a bit better than  BHP, especially around safety. Glencore pays the best, but it is very much sink or swim; perform or you will be terminated. \n\nLarger companies also have career progression opportunities within the company. Not unusual to have people stay for decades; probably not the most optimal for salary growth but it's stable. \n\nRemember that careers are a marathon, not a sprint. Find something that works for you and can be sustained long term. Can you survive constantly doing OT to push your salary higher? Probably not for the long term.",

      "post_selftext": "Hi everyone. \n\nI am looking for advice. \n\nA few months ago I came to Australia (Perth) from Europe interested in finding a job in the mining industry. I have a VISA working holiday.\n\nI have experience (3 years) as a shift supervisor/shift boss (cooking coal mines) working in the development areas of driving faces using blasting materials with steel sets, rebuilding old excavations, gluing the rockmass, mounting steel, and cable bolts, chain and belt conveyors, drainage in very difficult conditions of rockbursts, tremors, and methane in coking coal seams. I worked at levels mainly 1000 meters below the ground. Max 3 faces at a time and a crew of 20 - 40 people in total.\n\nI have a master's degree in mining, but I don't think that makes a difference in this case.\n\nOn the advice of a friend, I sent literally everywhere, even for mining engineer offers from opencast/underground mining. I have never used any software like Desvik at work. I have no planning experience. For supervising I do not have any tickets and it is impossible to make any without a mentor and/or materials from Australia.\n\nDo I have any chance of finding a job in the mining industry here?\n\nProbably someone of you has been in a similar situation or currently working in HR and knows what it looks like from the inside of the recruitment process.\n\nI  sent most resumes to BHP and Rio Tinto. I only got one SHL Talent Assessment from RT a month ago and that's it. All the positions I've applied for (9 at the moment in the \"processing\") are updated periodically, whatever that means. From BHP I got a few video assessments and now in processing is only one.\n\nI honestly admit that I lost hope a bit and I don't know if I should just find an office job for 6 months and then return to my country. Maybe my competencies are just too weak, I overestimated my abilities, and to get a job here you need to be an expert and have 10 years of experience in the industry.",

Anything involving technology or business improvement or data/reporting or project management in mining that someone will pay me for.\n\nBut pretty much every interview these days is a behavioural interview. Especially at Rio or BHP.\n\nExample question might be “Tell me about a time you had to work with a difficult team member.”\n\nUsing the STAR response would be something like:\nSituation - during 3rd your we had a group assignment to design a solar powered vehicle\nTask - Jimmy Bob was assigned responsibility for looking after designing the doors but wasn’t turning up to group meetings.\nAction - Jane Blogs and I went and found him at the social club and had a long conversation about responsibility and that he was letting the team down. We explained that he needed to have the door design done by Friday or we were going to have to speak to the lecturer.\nResponse - Lazy Bones McGee thanked us for being so honest with him and apologised for letting us down. Everyone at the social club stood up and clapped and L.B. McGee went straight home and finished the door design that night.\n\nI haven’t had a job interview for years but when preparing I usually just write out as many examples as I have of when I have faced a challenge  that I have overcome or performed well at something or whatever. Then just figure out what applies to whatever question they ask. Don’t feel awkward about taking some time to compose your thoughts and think of a good example. Otherwise you will be tempted to speak in generalities. Remember, even a bad story is better than generalities.",

Congratulations though I hope you crush the interview. \n\nIf it's a one way interview the best advice I can give is pay close attention to the instructions and question parameters. I tanked a one-way interview with Newmont by failing to notice the question had switched from unlimited response attempts to three response attempts.\n\nAgain, congratulations on getting to the second stage and good luck!\n",

      "body": "I think it's just how the market invests. A billion dollar company would pay more for the same job than a much smaller company would. Software and Comp Sci are the hottest things for tech investors and businesses. If there is more money in the pool, people get paid more. It has been getting more and more saturated, though. Blockchains and crypto were hot a decade ago, but nothing much came out of it. AI is hot currently, but worries are growing about not making a profit out of it. On the other hand, mechanical engineering markets have been shrinking in the US. The manufacturing market has been shrinking, and the money has been going to other countries like China. Construction is also similar. There has been plenty of innovation and profits, but it is just much smaller than what the tech has.",

While my mechanical engineers are earning at 80k-90k and they earn less than all the software engineers at the same company.\n\nBottom line is at top companies even at FAANG the mechanical engineers get paid significantly less than the software engineers and this is at every single company if there’s software engineers and mechanical engineers the software engineers are going to be paid much much much more than the mechanical engineers even at traditional engineering top firms such as Tesla which is hardware they still pay their mechanical/electrical engineers significantly less than their software engineering counterparts in fact a staff mechanical engineer literally earns much less than a senior software engineer and Staff role is like 5-8 years more of experience than senior",

      "body": "Software/Tech is much more easily scaled than Mechanical/hardware/electrical and any other traditional engineers. All you really need is a couple of guys with computers and you can create apps that reach millions if not billions and that’s pretty much how these Tech billionaires happened such as Facebook and Doordash etc. that’s pretty much it and the simple way why Tech/Software Engineering pays more than and especially at the top significantly much much more than any traditional engineering job because of the scale.\n\nAnyway my cousin is a mechanical engineer at Google and yes he still gets paid less than the software/tech guys but it’s kinda expected since FAANG is a tech/software company and product first but he still rakes in boatloads of money compared to the electrical or mechanical engineers who work in defence anyway.\n\nIdk if not being a traditional engineer is worth throwing away that amount of money right now and down the line as well lol take Google/FAANG mate\n\nIt’s your life anyway I wouldn’t let your parents decisions phase you plus it’s been years since you’re 18 you can make ur own decisions, good luck brother",

      "post_selftext": "Main question is to discuss but also tell me what I offer should pick?\n\nHello, So Ive been lucky to get multiple job offers I can take as a recent university graduate, I did a double degree in Computer Science and Mechanical engineering. So the offers I received for the mechanical/electrical engineering line at one of the big defence firms everyone knows and puts on a pedestal as well as the mining engineering Fly in fly out offer.\n\nSecond path is the Software Engineering offer at Google/FAANG which pays $130k more than all the mechanical/electrical/mining engineering roles offered.\n\nI’m fortunate enough to be able to go down both paths but I’m wondering what should I choose and why is the pay disparity this big for software/tech compared to graduate engineers. Even FAANG is the top of the line for mechanical/electrical engineers and the pay for mechanical/traditional engineers at the same top company FAANG was still less than the software guys so I ended up just telling the recruiter I’ll go for the software engineering path.\n\nThanks, grew up in low socioeconomic area so wondering what I should choose in the end but I’m wondering if I really am a true engineer if I take the money as it isn’t a traditional engineering role\n\nBut I’m just really curious to why this is the case even matching at a top company so it’s a bit more even the software/tech engineers get paid more than the traditional/mechanical engineers like even from levels fyi and from my own experiences and offers and friends/acquaintances have told.\nEven my dad is a team lead in mining engineering as a mining engineer yet my Software Engineering offer at FAANG pays more than that which is crazy.\n\nTLDR, FAANG software engineering offer laid 130k more than my highest traditional engineering offers which included mechanical and mining engineering job offers at top firms for traditional engineers such as Boeing, Defence and Rio Tinto. Also FAANG offered me interview and salary for Software Engineer and Mechanical Engineer role but the Software Engineering role still paid significantly higher so I just went with that.\n\nMy only gripe with not going with the software engineering job is that I won’t be seen as a real engineer by my family even though I’d earn more than them so I need help please guys with convincing my family too",

This initial stage won't be anything crazy: they'll ask high level questions about your background, why you want to work at Salesforce, etc. If they think you're a good fit, they'll push you along the process. That involves a video interview with the hiring manager, a video/phone interview with a peer panel, and a final presentation.\n\nThe role is aligned to the pre-sales organization. Essentially, you'll be responsible for meeting with businesses, understanding their problems, designing/architecting solutions that map to Salesforce products, and then demoing the solution.",

      "body": "K Keeping in mind I'm not the official spokesperson...\nYes, there has been some controversy- but most mines are going to have that. First off- the deposit is not at Apache leap, it is behind Apache Leap and we are not affecting the leap at all. When you say a defense budget earmark- I assume you mean the land exchange? \n\nWe've had the project and owned the land for the mine itself for years, since we bought it from the old Magma mine that was the reason for the town's existence. The land exchange is adjacent to the mine we have planned, and may or may not have minerals in it, we haven't drilled there yet to be sure. I am not privy to the workings and legalities etc so I really can't say why it was included in what bill.\nI can say that most people in this area are very supportive of the mine. We have done a lot of cleanup of the old mine workings that we were not responsible for. We provide money to the struggling town, and we are working to provide access to climbing spots that are being affected. Most of the opposition is either a) opposed to all mining/ just don't want mining to occur where they know about it- which is just not realistic, or b) believe that it is native american land. That is just false. This land is NOT Native American land.",

      "body": "Well, permitting takes forever, and that is assuming there is full 100% support from the community. As you can see in my above comment, even in districts that are traditionally known for mining, in a state known as the \"Copper State\"- there is opposition. You have to make sure the community knows what you are doing, you have to do environmental impact studies, you have to go through the NEPA process etc. This alone can take 20 years- a mine is a big project and they use a lot of land so you have to prove that you will be as careful as possible with the land.\n\nThen there are the practical aspects. Mines are super expensive to build- that money has to come from somewhere often investors. In order to explain why you need so much money,  you have to prove that you can get a return on the money- which means a drilling program. Drilling can take a while to get a good idea of the shape of a deposit, especially an underground one without any surface outcrops like ours. Then you have to take all that data and model it up just to get approval to start building. Then building the mine takes a while- ours will be a block cave so there is a lot of infrastructure that has to be constructed. Things like a tailings pile, conveyance system for moving ore, etc- all of it has to be planned and accounted for in advance, because a) you need to get it permitted and b) you need to be able to prove you can make a profit or investors won't pay.",

      "body": "Congrats!\n1) The transition from undergrad was surprisingly easy. We have a good training program, and for the most part there are really only 4 or 5 ore minerals that we work with regularly- so learning those is quick and painless.   We also have some required reading- several scientific papers etc, that help to get everyone kind of up to speed. \n\n2) So with the training and everything, I think maybe it was 6 months or so until I kind of understood the deposit/ how things worked, and obviously I am still increasing ore body knowledge, just at a slower pace now.\n\n3) The work- not really. Core logging is tedious and boring. Sampling and all that is ok, but a lot of the \"thinking\" part of the job is being replaced with technology. So for example,  I still do my copper estimations, but they get replaced by real data from assay scans. It starts to make you feel like you are just a tech. There are limited opportunities for projects or research, but for me not enough to outweigh the boredom. That is kind of why I started the website. I'm pretty bored and I'd like to move up to some new challenges, and really upset that the career advice from my management is just to wait it out for those rare opportunities. As For the people-kind of hit or miss. There are some very bright people in mining, and I have made some very good friends. There are also a lot of assholes, and being a woman I think this industry (and specific people I work with) has some problems with sexism. That's what I get for going into a male-dominated field though.\n\n4) I spend maybe 2-3 days a year, sadly. I wish it was more. But our deposit doesn't have a surface outcrop, so all our work stems from drill core. And, Rio Tinto has a separate department that does all the exploration work.\n\n5) I've never been in o&G so it's hard to be sure, but my friends in the field seem to make similar pay, but the work is a lot \"dirtier\". Maybe you live on the rig, whereas we work from a core shed and dont spend a lot of time on the rigs themselves. We keep all our core that isn't sampled, which I believe is different from O&G. And obviously, our rocks are totally different. We have a lot more complexity with ore bodies and porphyries than just simple sed/strat stuff. I didnt know what I wanted to do when I graduated but mining has been a reasonably good fit, especially now that I'm a Mom, although I'm really lucky to have been hired on a project near to a major city.",

I can't speak for other mines, but here and at the mines I have visited through work, about half of the geologists have a masters and half have just a bachelors. For what you start out doing (prepping core, doing quick logs, etc), a bachelor's is more than sufficient. Those with a master's get paid more for the same work though. Experience+ enthusiasm seems to be what gets you the furthest.\n\n2) I hope so! Obviously the mining industry is kind of fluctuating. We have managed several bad market downturns in the past 15 years or so without needing to layoff geologists, although it has come close. We have a huge deposit with a good grade, so we are fortunate to be able to expect to continue being funded by investors. Because the mine is underground, they expect to employ a team of geologists through the life of the mine (t least 50 years or so) as they continue shaping, although it might mean doing more underground work once the mine opens. But I expect if I wanted to stay that long, I could have a job til I retire.\n\n3)Thank you!",

As for the minerals- a bunch of neat stuff. Lots of azurite/ Malachite/ Chrysocolla/gypsum/barite. Plus Brochantite (spiky emerald green crystals), Aurichalcite (knobby coatings made of tiny turquoise-colored spiky crystals), Smithsonite (pink zinc rich crystals), Chalcanthite ( blue copper sulfate that dissolves in water), several sulfur salts, Grandviewite (a mineral identified and so far only found at the Canyon!), and several others. Check out mindat for pics/info on a lot of them...http://www.mindat.org/loc-3338.html \n\nIf you ever are visiting the Grand Canyon, call ahead and ask nicely to get access to the special collections when you visit and go check them out! It's such a waste that they got filed away in a special library that no one knows about. ",

There is a website if you want to find out more about the project. Personally, I do a lot of logging core, sampling management, presentations of findings, etc. Standard stuff.\n\nFinally, lately I have been exploring opportunities for side businesses/ outside advancement opportunities in geology.

In fact, we have a system where we log the core with the well logs (in WellCAD) in front of us at the same time so that we can verify and correlate structures found in image to the core and vice versa. This way we get better depth and orientations on our structural data, and can do some interpretation in rubble zones using any data the logs could get us.",

Bottom line is, we are really trying to work with the different opposing communites to allay their concerns and everything we do is very transparent (our mine plan of operations is even posted on our website).

      "body": "Well it depends on the price of copper obviously. Right now, it's looking pretty fortunate that we don't have a producing mine. Once you start production, its pretty expensive to sit on your heels and wait for the price of copper to go up- which is why a lot of companies are having a really tough time right now- they have to produce because otherwiise they are wasting money, but they are making a lot less profit than was anticipated/operating at a loss. Vs we can just slowly build our infrastructure, expecting that the price of copper will go up by the time we produce.  I think the current estimate is that the first 5-10 years of the 50+ year mine life will be just paying our investors back, and we are targeting the highest grade zones to be mined first.",

      "post_selftext": "Hi, I am a geologist with 5 years of experience. I went to a couple different schools for undergrad. Santa Barbara City College has an amazing program for those looking for a cheap program with a ton of field trips and a field course before you transfer to a 4-year school. I transferred to Northern Arizona University, and graduated from there with just your basic geology degree. While in school I did a thesis on carbonate sediments in the Nankai trough subduction zone, but other than that I did nothing really outstanding in school. \n\nRegardless, I got a short-term position with Geotemps at the grand canyon right after school. I was hired to classify something like 2000 mineral samples that the park had confiscated from a guy who had been stealing from one of the old copper mines in the park. I spent aboout 9 months living at the Grand Canyon going through these incredibly rare minerals/possibly \"new\" minerals and trying to figure out what they were/classify them/ organize them for the archives. I also supplemented my income by doing lectures on the formation of the Grand Canyon to tour buses. It was an awesome summer.\n\nThen, while working there, I got hired for my current project. It is copper-moly mine that is proposed to open sometime in the next 10-15 years. It will be an underground block-cave mine, and I am part of the shaping team. This prospect is owned by Rio Tinto.

      "body": "Sorry I somehow missed this last week. Mostly it's because of necessity. We start at the top of the hole with the biggest option drilling from surface (for us, PQ/ 85 mm). This stuff is heavy for the complete runs, and at some point the hole reaches a depth where its just too heavy with the weight of the drill string and everything, so we switch to HQ/ 63.5 mm. We'd prefer to drill the whole hole in HQ because its just sturdier and easier to see features, but often we again have weight issues (if we are deep) or get stuck rods. If we get stuck we leave the HQ casing, reduce to a smaller size (NQ), and keep going. Most of our holes will have to reduce to NQ at some point, we get stuck a lot (pretty faulted/messy rocks) and it seems to be easier to maneuver. Finally, we sometimes are forced to reduce to BQ/ 36.5mm (like if we get stuck rods but we are already using NQ rods), but we don't like to because that hole size is too small to fit our survey tools so we have to \"log blind\", plus it breaks a lot more usually.",
